2,"MUST READ Friends who are going Another location error More than 1 hour waste of time and fuel It is possible to pass through Dalyan by ferry in 5 minutes Do not wander around K√∂yceƒüiz Lake in vain The maps do not show the ferry for some reason, so it shows a 2-hour route If your route is from Marmaris to Dalyan, first visit Kaunos, then see the King Tombs, 17 km away, right before you cross the street (although it is closed, but can be seen more closely from the road or by entering the cemetery there) Then, take the ferry to Dalyan (5 minutes and 32 TL) Coming to the ancient city, don't expect too much by looking at the comments, there isn't much preserved, it's more like a ruin But it's definitely worth the trip For example, I say that you should definitely see the mosaic that I put in the image Some comments say ""forget all the ancient cities you've seen"" or something",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

207,"You can enter with a museum card It's a little hard to come by You will either go around K√∂yceƒüiz with your car for more than 1 hour or you will cross the road with a ferry, which is more logical Since we have children spread over a very large area, we could not visit the lower parts, we only visited the upper parts We have not seen any work that has not been done on an unmaintained ancient city Still, I think it's worth going",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
208,"Entrance is 1750 TL for those who have a museum card The museum card can also be bought from the entrance point for 60 TL If you are interested in historical places, you can visit all the places for free for 1 year by paying 60 TL If we come to Kaunos, it is worth a visit You will cross the mountain in a short time The ferry fee is 23 TL per vehicle, it takes about 3-5 minutes to cross",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

227,"The ancient city of Dalyan is on the must-see list after seeing the splendor of the king's tombs It is a large city and the theater is particularly well preserved The mosaics behind the church are another proof that the same patterns were used in all Anatolian lands Only the entrance was a bit of a surprise, as if the wires were cut, you can reach the real entrance above when you say that we are entering a leak Don't be misled",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

788,Visited late August 2021 Took the ferry (by car - 23TL each way) from the Dalyan ferry and then drove 15km to the site You can also go by car (90 minutes) or on foot Not a lot of parking but enough Wear sneakers Small shop inside if you want to buy drinks/snacks Enough shade if hot Allow approximately 90 minutes to explore A few information boards also in English Great photo opportunities You get a real sense of antiquity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

791,"am visiting Dalyan for the second time and this GREEK city is very interesting If you come to Dalyan, you can't miss a two or three hour getaway I came with my dog, we had dinner on the way (many women sell juice) and they make pancakes It's a regional thing It's sad to see that there isn't enough archeological rescue for these cities by the country Otherwise I would visit again I recommend getting there really early because the summer sun is awful and bring water in your backpack",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

797,"This is an ancient Roman city with a large number of buildings It also has a round theater with lots of seating inside The theater is large but empty Honestly, it's great there But there is 1 problem: I had to go to the toilet, but I couldn't find it directly because there were trees blocking the view of the WC sign But the rest of the city was fine",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

803,"There is so much to see We should have arranged for longer than an hour but we will be back to do it justice There were a few areas that were inaccessible due to the restructuring, but that had little effect on our appreciation of what was before us We were lucky enough to get there early so the crowds were minimal, but I hope the crowd can be tolerated even during peak hours A hidden gem that benefits from minimal publicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
804,"Expression of ancient beauty, cheap boat (75tl return) and entrance (14tl) Coming here in the early morning of March, when the weather is not hot and the tourists are still sleeping, is very appealing Be prepared to walk, it will take 20 minutes from the last tea garden to the entrance The entryway is poorly maintained and makes you more into history Spend at least 2 hours admiring the lagoon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
805,"Dalyan is one of the most memorable and worth seeing places in Turkey, especially if you want to feel the touch of history For a small entrance fee you can see the beautiful ancient historical site (dating back to the 10th century BC) The dried up area that was once the sea, now the sea is far away and the ancient ruins of the amphitheater and old city that were mighty and mighty a day ago - amazing and monumental#KaunosDalyan#KaunosDalyanTurkey#KaunosT√ºrkiye#TurkeyTourism",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

807,"Worth a visit if you are staying in Dalyan After boarding the kayak service along the river, it's a 10-15 minute stroll through the rustic countryside, past street vendors selling pomegranate smoothies and jams, before reaching the sloped access road to the grounds 25tl buys you entry and you are free to roam in all directions Each area has multiple information boards that let you know what was previously used, such as a church, bathhouse or private building It is a very pleasant and fascinating place to visit but there is only the cafe area that offers shade",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
808,"Quite an interesting place with a preserved ancient city from the first half of the 1st century BC former AD Amphitheater, baths, temples and many other stone buildings I would like more information support for exhibitions But they all look great together",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
809,"It is an ancient city that can be easily reached from both Marmaris and Fethiye Ancient theater with some other ruins and very beautiful views There are also Lycian rock tombs just a few kilometers away I took the ferry to Kaunos, then walked through the orange groves towards the tombs The entrance was closed but you can see them from the road and the walk was still nice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
810,It is on the UNESCO tentative list of Turkey and it is easy to understand why (Although the amphitheater is quite small) and covers a large area and has many well-preserved tourist attractions The entrance fee was 14 TL It can also be visited by taking a boat tour from the nearby city of Dalyan Or you can take the ferry across the river by foot (5tl for pedestrians),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

813,"Intern and nice place You can reach Dalyan by boat, by passing the spill or by ferry, in a car",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
814,"There is so much to see in Kaunos, the 3 main areas, the temple on the hill, the amphitheater and the fountain It's hot there, so the walk to the temple or the tractor and caravan is hot Go early in the morning to miss the midday heat Now you can reach most areas that are better protected but still offer better views It dates back to the early Roman period and is still wonderful to walk in the footsteps of the ancients",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
815,"Historically interesting place You may need at least 4 hours to see interesting things in a calm manner You can see many amphibians such as turtles, but beware of snakes if you walk alone in less visited places",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

817,"It's an archaeological place mostly frequented by Europeans, it has a Roman theater and some existing and ruined Roman ruins, the place is about an hour from the highway, it's true that the road is full of nature's beauties, but it's tiring because of the many winding roads of the line, there are beautiful lakes and views on the site, but useful for others History and antique lovers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
818,"What was built back then is impressive If you follow the red dots and arrows towards the mountain behind the theatre, you will be rewarded with a magnificent view It is tiring and should be done with only about 1 liter of water per person and good shoes But it's worth it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
819,Wonderful ancient city and surrounding landscapes In my opinion these are the best ruins in the area Goats and donkeys were a delightful bonus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

821,Worth a few hours of your time 5 TL charabanc type tractor towed to go there; worth avoiding the long walk up the hill There are a few dotted explanatory notes in Turkish and English that are helpful The old auditorium is gorgeous,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
822,very nice place The only sad thing is that you can admire it from the side while on board No one is allowed to come near Big turtles were promised to us on this tour We have seen them from afar They go up for a second to get some air and dive back in That's why photographing them is unrealistic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
823,"A beautiful place to explore I wanted to climb and you can do well here Sturdy shoes are highly recommended as there is a lot of rubble At the top, you have a great 360¬∞ view",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
824,We went an hour before the entrance closed at 5pm and had the whole space to ourselves Wandering around the town and the theater ruins is truly magical Imagine yourself in the hustle and bustle of the ancient port settlement as you head towards Leech Lake Have a picnic or go to Dalyan at sunset for a meal by the river,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
825,"Beautiful historical place to see On the other side of the river You can get there by boat trip or cross the river in a small boat run by a local woman and then take a little walk It's worth going there, I highly recommend it",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
826,"It's basically a unique ancient city perched on an idyllic hill with a wonderful 360-degree view We took small boats run by local women to cross the river and decided to walk up the hill for about 25 minutes It's hard to say the least in hot weather But what we got in the end exceeded our expectations There aren't many people around You will need more than 3 hours to see them all Bring food and drink by yourself as the muze cafe is a complete rip-off, now they sell a small bottle of water for 5 TL (2018), it is priced at 05 TL in grocery stores like SOK",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

829,"Awesome, I haven't finished it all yet, but I like that the staff take such good care of the place and keep it clean 24 hours, I just have to realize there are some dangerous snakes inside, I saw one on the wall, it's not moving, it didn't follow me, mostly it won't touch you and safely You will walk around, just be careful when touching walls or sitting on an old stone",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
830,Magnificent archaeological park with a theater and very well preserved thermal baths The easiest transportation is by boat from Dalyan district Then count the 20-minute walk The rock tombs can be seen on the opposite shore next to the shops and hotels in Dalyan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

837,"One of the best archaeological sites I have visited And the way we achieve it is also very interesting A kayak from Dalyan Turkey along the river, then a 2km walk down a very quiet country road Local vendors selling cold drinks and lavender products along the way Kaunos itself was only 20tl to enter (Approximately ¬£1) The entire site is a treasure trove of history",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

920,was here about 15 years ago and it was great Some work is being done to preserve this ancient site and on top of that it was free Now You have to pay to look at the attempt to destroy the place The amphitheater began to collapse Its entrance is used as a goat barn Some of the interiors have been dismantled and lost Goats and cows running around trample the ruins Most of the subdivisions were submerged Some of the good old walkways have disappeared and have been replaced by other stones What a shame for the authorities who have to deal with this Surly their offices are in immaculate condition Paid with UNESCO Money for the protection of ancient sites in Turkey Shameful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

947,"An ancient city spread over a wide area It's always improving as archaeologists get together more There is an amphitheater, baths and many more ruined structures Unbelievable It's mind-blowing that a civilization more than 2,000 years old can be this complex and modern",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
948,Small excavated archaeological site with a fantastic amphitheater,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
949,"Maybe because it was cloudy because it didn't make a crazy impression Brought to boats Give it an hour It takes 12-15 minutes to walk to Kaunus The amphitheater is tatty (it would be possible to collect stones on each other, most of them were simply thrown away, they did not provide audio guides, there is a cafe, you can drink tea from a bag)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

956,"It seems that the city was once interesting, but in fact there are many ruins, some of which have been gradually rebuilt We were here the second day after Ephesus and therefore Kaunos did not enter, Ephesus is much more interesting and here goats and donkeys graze in the area, as a result of which it turned out to be an impossible task to not participate in rubbish, little information about the stands, plus the daytime heat and absence of shadows invalidated all impressions We came to Kaunos from Dalyan, left the car in the parking lot and for 15 liras (that's the price of a two-way boat), our grandmother carried us to the other side of the river by boat We walked 20-25 minutes to Kaunos On the way, we admired the view of the Lycian tombs carved into the rocks, the cemetery and the pomegranate gardens On the way back, we bought cold pomegranate and fresh orange juice from the locals (10 lira for 025 lira) and it really somehow saved us from the heat I recommend visiting only if you are a big fan of antiquity and have previously collected information about the city itself on the Internet Entry is 14 lira",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
