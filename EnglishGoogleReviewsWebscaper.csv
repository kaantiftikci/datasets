We had to be a perfect country, in fact, I only counted 17 Ancient Cities on the map. We live in lands where all Civilizations want to live. It is truly magnificent! Again, there was a trip where we thought, “How was it done if it was such a long time ago?” You can enter the museum with a card or ticket entry is 25 TL. In the ancient city, there are churches, theaters and many other things that we cannot understand. You must visit 👏🏻 If you want to go to Dalyan, you must take the mermaid ferry for 35 TL in 5 minutes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"MUST READ Friends who are going. Another location error. More than 1 hour waste of time and fuel!!!! It is possible to pass through Dalyan by ferry in 5 minutes. Do not wander around Köyceğiz Lake in vain. The maps do not show the ferry for some reason, so it shows a 2-hour route. If your route is from Marmaris to Dalyan, first visit Kaunos, then see the King Tombs, 1.7 km away, right before you cross the street (although it is closed, but can be seen more closely from the road or by entering the cemetery there). Then, take the ferry to Dalyan. (5 minutes and 32 TL) Coming to the ancient city, don't expect too much by looking at the comments, there isn't much preserved, it's more like a ruin. But it's definitely worth the trip. For example, I say that you should definitely see the mosaic that I put in the image. Some comments say ""forget all the ancient cities you've seen"" or something.";none;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos is an impressive ancient city. You can cross the road in 2-3 minutes by ferry from Dalyan. After that, you go a distance of about 5 minutes by car. The ferry fee is 32 liras. Since it is a 4 car ferry, it fills up immediately so you don't have to wait. B.C. It is thought that Anatolian people lived here in the 6th century. There are church ruins from the 6th century AD and a very beautiful ancient theater. There are information signs for each building. It is possible to see free-running goats. It is as if the works are not yet finished. I think over time it will become much more regular. The museum card is valid, if you don't have a museum card, the entrance is 25 lira. It's a must see place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You may have to take some trouble for exciting transportation to visit beautiful historical places, but it is worth it. The ancient city, which is a museum area, is very big, as it is enjoyable to visit, but at least ignore your tiring 3-4 hours. I think it will be more fun if you do research before you go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a beautiful ancient city. You can enter the museum with a card. The ancient city, formerly Kbid, is located in the middle of the Caria and Lycian roads. It is one of the places to go when you come to Köyceğiz. But most places are under renovation. The theater also collapsed. You can also see the famous royal tombs. You can come from both Çandır village and Dalyan by ferry. The village is also very cute. If you come from Çandır, the road is very beautiful. You can also stop by Ekincik Bay and Sultaniye Hot Springs on the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
To reach the ruins of the city of Kaunos, we crossed by boat and followed the walking path to the old world. The journey by boat took 5-10 minutes on average. It was very nice to experience the peace of being in the calm waters of Dalyan river. The walking path took 20-25 minutes. Our tour time in the city was 1 and a half and 2 hours, if you are curious, it can take even longer. There is a counter on the way before reaching the ancient city, wonderful handmade products, pomegranate juice, soap, oils, replicas of the coins used by the inhabitants of the ancient city of Kaunos, souvenirs... A must-visit place on vacation...+ PLEASE DO NOT THROW YOUR CIGARETTE BUTTS AND TRASH...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city in Dalyan. A must visit when in the area. Entry with a museum card. The ticket was 25 TL. The view is also very good. There are different alternatives for transportation. It is possible to reach by boat, ferry or car.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Forget about all the ancient cities you've seen before... Whether you're interested in history or not, the Ancient City of Kaunos amazes you with the mystery of a civilization thousands of years ago and its incredible mechanical genius for the quality of life. I strongly recommend you to visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We are very impressed here. It's a place worth spending a lot of time exploring. We passed here from Dalyan by ferry and our car. There is an entrance with a museum card. Restoration work continues. A lost secret history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Spring months are very suitable for visiting the region. We rented a boat from Dalyan, bought blue crabs from the cooperative on the way and had them cooked on the boat, it was a great trip. Excavations had just begun in Kaunos, and the accident tombs are wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a place that can be visited all day long with its surroundings. When you climb the castle, a magnificent view where you can see the Iztuzu, the ancient city and Dalyan rock tombs in 360 degrees awaits you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We came across a period in which excavations were continuing. The theater stage and the main building were closed. You can enter Dalyan or Köyceğiz with an ancient city muzekkart, which those who pass by can visit and see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great place absolutely bridal atmosphere is great. But everything except water is exorbitantly priced, sprite 27 TL, ice cream 40 TL, these numbers are quite fantastic, the entrance fee is 20 TL per person, free for children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you are a stone and ancient civilization lover like me, definitely go. Excavations are still going on. See what ancient people did. You can log in with a Muzekart, which is more convenient. Get a hat and sturdy shoes or slippers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Inside the ruins of the 6th century BC, a church from the 6th century AD, the Amphitheater with a magnificent view. You can enter with your museum card.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Well preserved, interesting ancient city to see. A museum card is sold at the entrance, you can also enter with the barcode of the museum card application you get from your smartphone. It is also possible to reach the region with the small car ferry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I went 3 times and it's an amazing place.. definitely a place to go. If you have a museum card, the entrance is free, otherwise you pay 25 TL per person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A place that I can recommend to anyone who likes to visit historical places is the ancient city of Kaunos. It is a place where you can cross from Dalyan by boat and reach it with a 10-minute walk. Don't forget to take your water with you. Before you go, do your research about kaunos and wander around the ancient city. It was pleasant experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Caunos BC An ancient city belonging to a home is in disrepair. Excavations are still going on. It's not a place worth going especially, but they talk to tours in Dalyan and they drop off and pick you up as a last stop. There is an entrance fee of 25 TL, don't forget to take your museum card with you. Haaaa, 30 meters before the entrance, you can pass through the wires on the left, they left it open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You have several options to come here. Either by car from the west side of Köyceğiz, by ferry from the center of Dalyan, by your car again, or by walking across the boats drawn by the very sweet sisters from the center of Dalyan. We went by boat (20 TL round trip per person). Then we reached the ancient city by walking in front of the king tombs, through a very cute village, and we had a great time. If you like walking, I suggest you go with the last option, taking into account that you will also visit the ancient city. Enjoyable walks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Work continues on the ancient city. Museum card is valid. Landscape is very beautiful. Advice go after 16:00. We used the rowing boat crossing from Dalyan. The boat dropped us off at Meriç Büfe. Along the way, local aunts sell pomegranate juice, orange juice, honey and knitted clothes. We drank pomegranate juice from both aunts, they were both very nice. It is 25-30 minutes walking distance between the bus stop and the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"We had a very nice ancient city tour. It would be great if there was a guide. It is also possible to find interesting information on the internet about the ""green-faced urban dwellers"". Keep your eyes on the stones on the way to the temple, both out of respect and you may sprain your feet.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ancient city entrance fee is 25 tl under 18 is free. It is a beautiful place with ancient ruins spread over a large area. It can be seen if you have an interest and love for history. Don't go without a hat and without water. It's a 15-minute walk from Dalyan by ferry for 8.50 TL per person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An unmissable ancient city. You can easily cross from Dalyan by ferries with 3-4 cars departing every 15 minutes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The place smells very nice of history, there is an amphitheater with a beautiful view, the entrance price is very affordable, and there is a museum card at the same time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos, which was a commercially important port city in Antiquity, lost its port feature over time as the sea was filled with alluvium. It is an ancient city located in the Caria region of Anatolia. It is located within the borders of Çandır Neighborhood of Köyceğiz district of Muğla. The Kaunos Rock Tombs are most easily seen from the Dalyan neighborhood of the Ortaca district of Muğla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the historical places of our country that must be visited, it enchants people with its history, scenery and beauty, and it is a beautiful and clean well-kept place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a very beautiful and historical ancient city, if only the marbles for restoration were a bit like the real thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Restoration works for a very large ancient city worth seeing are continuing, but there is no restoration that reflects much history, frankly, excavations continue here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
When you come to Dalyan, make a tour by boat and take a break in the ancient city of Kaunos, or after about 2 km (if I remember correctly) after crossing the pier by car ferry, you reach the ancient city. You arrive at the city after a 10-15 minute walk and I would definitely recommend you to climb to the top of the theater and enjoy the view from the highest angle possible. The atmosphere of those times and the beauty that cannot be enjoyed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The entrance fee is 20 TL. Museum card is valid for the year 2022. details are at bujuyollarda.com;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos was a wonderful ancient city. It is much more visited than many ancient cities in the vicinity. Especially the part of Agora square was quite impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The road passes around Köyceğiz Lake and connects to the mountain road. The roads are very curved, but it is a historical structure worth seeing. You can see the rock tombs, which are visible in the photos, by the riverside by ferrying to Dalyan. It is also seen by Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Entrance is available with a museum card. Entrance is free with a teacher card. Individual admission is 17 TL. Directions are few. There are very beautiful buildings, the view of the ancient theater is magnificent. The roads on the temple side are very beautiful. Excavations continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
have visited many ancient cities, but unfortunately this place has been abandoned to its fate. First of all, although transportation from Dalyan center seems practical, it is not so in hot weather. It didn't make much sense to cross the boat at 6 pm and walk 2-3 km. Even if the sun does not burn, your shirt turns into a salt lake as you sweat. After a long walk, you don't have to wander around the city. Make sure to bring plenty of water and liquids with you. Admission is free for teachers. If I had known that the walking distance after the boat was this long, maybe I wouldn't have come, it was experiential learning. The remains were randomly excavated from the ground but left in a scattering. At the entrance of the theater, some marbles were brought for restoration but were left idle. Part of the theater has collapsed. Be careful not to fall while going up and down the stairs. In summary, I recommend you to visit this ancient city from the photos during the summer period. Beware of small and cattle droppings as it is open to natural life. Lizards are also available. After returning from the ancient city, on the bank of the river, drink your tired coffee in the tea garden of Dalyan municipality ☕ (The fire that broke out in Köyceğiz in August 2021 was seen in Dalyan, unfortunately the smoke of the fire can be seen in the photos);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Dalyan is a magnificent heritage with its history and scenery. I ask the authorities, please arrange the walking paths and shade them with awnings to provide shade. It is very difficult to walk on the rocks with slippers in this 45 degree heat. WC is available. There is also a small buffet at the entrance where cold drinks and tea are available.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos, a Lycian port city, is now far inland from the coast. The ancient city can be reached by walking 1 km from Dalyan, the rock tombs at the entrance to the city are impressive, on the other hand, it is about 3 km. long fortification walls, stoa, agora, fountain, bath, theater and temple ruins reveal that Kaunos was a fully organized city in the ancient period. The city, which was enriched by the salt trade, had a hard time with the malaria epidemic. The city, which was widely inhabited during the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods, was inhabited until the end of the 6th century AD. Restoration and excavation works continue, I saw some wrong restoration examples, seriously sad, careful. has to be...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The museum can be visited with a card. Dalyan is a very pleasant place;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Of course, the Ancient City of Kaonos is one of my favorite travel destinations. As a history lover, I have a different love for Ancient Cities. My only regret about the Ancient City is that it has been left alone for years as usual. They were doing restoration when we went, there were excavation sites. Officials who don't want to tell you where to start. They give brochures or not. We don't know if there is any. You're on your way to wherever you set your sights on your own. I'm sure there is no way to the Castle, which stands in front of me with its magnificent view. In order not to endanger yourself, you interrupt the walk and go back. I asked the officer, he says there is a path, but there is nothing to see anyway. There is nothing for you, but there was a lot for me. and one further I thought it had the necessary technology. The details in the works that have survived to this day make you feel this. It is in a perfect location with its nature. We made our trip in the evening hours. We especially preferred these hours because both not to be overwhelmed by the heat and to have better picture taking. Take water with you while walking. There is a cafe at the entrance of the city. The fee is 17.5 TL per person. Have a pleasant trip already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can reach Dalyan by boat (20TL per person round trip) and take a long walk in front of the King Tombs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An ancient port city. It is a must see place for everyone who comes to the region. Information in the ancient city should be more descriptive and understandable. It would be more logical to visit the region in March and April, it is recommended to visit the region in the summer, in the very hot evening or early in the morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is not a place to visit in a short time. You should spare at least 3 hours so that you can only travel in general terms. If you are a little more detailed, it will take 5-6 hours comfortably. The entrance is separate, the amp is separate, the lower part is more separate. Of course, there is no maintenance like everywhere else. This is the sad reality of our country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Perfect place. You literally feel the history. It takes 20 minutes by boat. You'll be there with a 15-minute walk. You can only walk around in 2-3 hours. Tour owners are trying to shorten the time. Don't let it. Make sure to go down to the beach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a very beautiful place, everyone who is interested in history should come and see it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An ancient city dating back to the 6th century BC. It was established on the slope of Dalyan Stream. With the formation of the Dalyan delta, it is now far from the sea coast. One of the important trade ports of the period. In a larger area than I anticipated. There are a lot of ruins and it is well preserved. A must visit place. I went in the evening because it would be hot, I didn't have much time. I had to travel very fast. That's why I'm thinking of going again. At least 2-3 hours are required. The museum card is valid, if there is no museum card, there is an entrance fee of 25 TL. If you are on the Dalyan side, there is a ferry, it crosses in 5 minutes, and after 3 minutes by car, you are at the entrance of the ancient city. The ferry is a small ferry for 3-4 vehicles. There are king tombs just below the ancient city, and then you should definitely see it. The lower part of the king tombs is the new cemetery, you can go to the bottom of the king tombs by entering here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a bit of an edge, the roads are a bit troublesome. We can go back and forth a lot. The forest road is very beautiful, with a good view, I think you should go in the morning. Correction: You can go in a much shorter time by crossing from Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city is enormous, it has a mystical state where you can feel like you are living in that era. Its history dates back to 300 BC. Partially restored, not bad. However, it seems as if the excavation has stopped and left a bit to itself. There is no parking etc. in terms of location and your vehicle is under direct sun in summer. It would be great if they could keep the pool full all the time. I advise. Not an Ephesus, Side, facilis but worth it. If you want, you can pass directly to Dalyan by ferlboat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a very beautiful small ancient city, but as the excavations continue, one should not expect too much. Museum card is valid, parking is limited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
very beautiful ancient city with its history and location, the works are still in progress and it will be even more beautiful when it is finished. You can enter the museum with your card.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city of Kaunos in Dalyan was founded in the 4th century BC. There are many places such as King Rock tombs, ancient theater, square etc. I think it is a place that should be visited by everyone who goes to Koyucegiz or Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A Caria (Caria) city.-The Ancient City of Kaunos, founded by the son of Miletos, Kaunos.-Just as in Milet (Didim) and Tralles (Aydin), alluviums took the place of the waters and moved away from the sea.-Christian Period as much as Roman Period. -You can reach Dalyan by ferry or raft. -Acropolis, Turkish Bath, Temples, Basilica and Churches, Theatre, Monuments, Measuring Platform and Fountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We went to visit this ancient city as a family. There is a ferry crossing from Dalyan. We wandered around a lot because we didn't know. Ferry fee is 32₺, entrance to the ancient city is 25₺, free for under 18 years old. Restoration work continues. If you go, stop by, otherwise I don't think you should go there to see it, date: August 17, 2022;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Museum card is valid. Wide in area. In the summer period, you should go either early in the morning or in the evening, it is easier to travel. The place is well preserved. You can reach the center in 10 minutes in total by taking the ferry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is quite difficult to reach. It's quite a large area. There is a castle on the hill, I couldn't find where to go. I suggest you go down to the port at the bottom, there are good things;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I recommend it to everyone, entrance adult 17.5, museum pass passes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is quite far from the city center and it is necessary to walk in the city. The parking lot must be 300m ahead. The burial part of the city remains where the people are stationed, and it is possible to photograph from afar. There are eating and drinking places by the Azmak river. You can enter the center of Dalyan from the ancient city on the right and pass by ferry. Ferries arrive in 15 minutes. There are boat tours available for Azmak, 100 ₺ per person. You can go to iztuzu beach in the center of Dalyan, there is a long distance entrance 15₺ sunbeds separate fees, the beach is beautiful, go early, it's worth it when you go. have a nice holiday;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
When you go here, do not leave without visiting the culture house of Uncle Mehmet Varol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient theater is under restoration and its entrance is closed. It can be visited in the scattered ancient city. My advice to the visitors is to continue down the road and see Dalyans. And from there, you can take a tour inside by boat and go to the Rock Tombs area. Otherwise, it may not meet your expectations. The transportation from Köycegiz is reached by a road with a slightly deteriorated coating in the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It has two departures by sea and by land. If you are on the Daylan side, the boats going to Iztuzu beach are waiting for you to bring you here as well. The entrance fee is 17.50 TL. If you have a museum card, you can enter for free. The structure of the ancient city is in good condition, but it needs better protection to survive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Everywhere is paid. Am I not a citizen of this state? Come on, you charge tourists, why are you taking money from my own citizens? Such places should be free for citizens of the Republic of Turkey. Our grandfathers defended this land and won it. Now what are you hiding from whom and taking it away? Absolutely unfair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It was the most beautiful ancient city I visited after Ephesus. The view was so beautiful that it was like a painting wherever I looked. I suggest you go around 5-6 in an hour when the sun is not overhead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
So I don't know what to say. I'm giving 5 stars just because I love places like this. We drove an hour and a half. We jumped in and didn't take cash with us. We came back because the credit card was not accepted. We called the Ministry of Culture. They said that such a thing would not be possible and that they had to have a credit card. A study will be started on this. We then went to other rock tombs. Cards were not accepted at the entrance there either. We don't know which one is lying. By the way, we were not offered this option, but when we called the ministry of culture, we were told that we could buy an online museum card and enter with a QR code.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city of Dalyan is a little far from 20 25 minutes walking distance. We crossed by boat and walked along the rock tombs road. There were also those who came by ferry or boat tours. If you come by ferry or boat tour, the walking path may be shortened a little. It is worth seeing the theater as a solid structure. Museum and teacher cards are valid. Drinks etc. are sold only in one place inside. Prices are a bit high for local tourists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you are going by boat to this place with small children, consider that there is a 15-20 minute walking path. We came with a daily boat tour, so we had a total of 1 hour time, it was not enough to visit all parts of it. prefer. The view is magnificent. Entrance 17,5₺;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a wonderful ancient city in terms of location and scenery. It operates under the Ministry of Culture. You can enter for free with your museum card. Single entry fee is 25.00 TL. The theater part of the ancient city is currently under renovation. So there is no entry for that part. It will be one of the most important ancient cities in a few years. You can enjoy the view of both Iztuzu Beach and Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you want to visit a big city, it will not save you less than 2 hours. It is a beautiful city that hosts the artistic, cultural and scientific elements of the period such as theatre, bathhouse, commercial place, place of worship and observatory. Don't go when the sun is up, you'll get burned. If possible, go with a guide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a very impressive ancient city, and its view is legendary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Unfortunately, it is an ancient city that can be visited in a very short time by ferry or as part of boat tours in Dalyan. It should be visited due to its location and historical importance. The way to go is pleasant, the museum card is valid. As of the date, the entrance fee is 25 TL per person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Although the excavations continue, there is still much to see (for the curious). You can reach Dalyan by ferry. It runs every 15 minutes between 08:00 and 20:00. Be sure to see the theater, the presentation area and the agora. The museum card is valid at the entrance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
In the ancient city, you can visit the theater with a capacity of 5,000 people, a basilica, a hammam, an agora, the Temple of Demeter and the areas with mosaics of 1,300 years old. Curiosity arouses excitement. The texture of 3 thousand years of history is very beautiful. It is very exciting to feel the civilization of 3 thousand years ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It takes 20 minutes to cross by boat. I reached it on foot. Entry is 25 TL. Do not go in the heat of July at noon like me, you will get burned. If you are going to go, take plenty of water and something like a microfiber towel or handkerchief to wipe your sweat. Don't walk with slippers, there are lots of thorns. There is a toilet at its door, which is not very comfortable, where cows sleep. It is a 3000-year-old ancient city spread over a very large area and containing a lake (Sülülük Göl). Unfortunately, I couldn't see it all. I would like to go again in a suitable season. Do not be afraid of the donkeys, by the way, they are very cute. Do not forget to greet the archaeologists at the excavation site. They're pulling history out of the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It was a perfect day for us. We crossed the road with our car by ferry from dalyan, parked at the place we passed and went to the ancient city on foot. The entrance fee is 25 TL per person. We toured the city for 2 hours. a different feeling. it is advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You should definitely go to the ancient city of Kaunos. But you should spend at least 1-1.5 hours because you discover that there are quite large and more and more different areas. There is also a small cafe at the entrance of the city where you can drink soda tea. In addition, you may encounter snakes on the way. I definitely recommend that you pay attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An ancient city spread over a very large area. The location and preservation of the ancient theater is excellent. The historical artifacts spread over the wetland below create a beautiful view. Villagers' goats, sheep and animals in nature such as squirrels, turtles and frogs leave people with different emotions. Promotional signs are sufficient, but the sign showing the sketch of the area should be renewed. Also, the direction signs after Çandır are very inadequate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Although it is a somewhat interesting mode of transportation, it should be seen. But don't go in summer, it's not enjoyable. You can go to Dalyan by ferry instead of going through the winding roads. You can also come here from Dalyan and it takes a very short time. ferry price 32 TL for car;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's an area to visit. Market and toilet are available. It is closed due to the pandemic, but there is a small area with chairs where you can sit and have a drink. The theater, olive trees and the scenery are uniquely beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Since the region is completely wetland, even the nature is very beautiful. In the spring, you will visit the ancient city with birds, turtles, reptiles, and villager sheep, goats and donkeys. The front of the settlement, which was a port city in ancient times, and its surroundings are mostly swamps. It has both water and land access by boats. Museum pass. You can go up the hill and the acropolis from the path that follows the theater. It is a bit of a steep and tiring path, but the view is magnificent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a peaceful ancient city surrounded by nature with its theatre, Roman bath at the entrance, but mostly the temple and harbor ruins as you descend towards the port. It is pleasing to see that the excavations are progressing when I go every 6 years, but it is sad that it still does not attract the attention of local tourists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It was very beautiful. I definitely recommend everyone to visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a beautiful and fascinating ancient and archeological site that smells of history. We see ruins everywhere, but it is possible to access the history of these remains. Just don't go there in the heat. I recommend going when the weather is cooler.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a place to go and see, but restoration work has been done and these works have damaged that natural structure a little. (Can be entered with a museum card) museum card 60 TL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is among the places to be seen while in Dalyan. We chose to go by car. Crossing by ferry (32 TL). For those who will return to Muğla, I prefer to go back to Dalyan center. The other road is asphalt but winding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is a beautiful view. It was very enjoyable to drink tea, especially with the royal tombs, but the tea garden where we always sit has been completely destroyed and a new place is being built in its place. We also saw small cavities a little further ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city is not fully excavated, there is no exit to the castle, we could not visit the ancient theater, there is a film being taken, no information is given at the door, take water with you, excavations and restorations continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I can say that Dalyan is the only place of boutique and comfort for me, I recommend you the restaurants, the wonderful rock tombs, the unique type of boat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Especially the theater of the ancient city looked magnificent and big, we couldn't see it due to the excavations, I hope the theater will be opened soon after the work is completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A 3000-year-old city, its walls/parts remaining until this time are on display. However, there are no museums, visuals, etc. about urban life. Most places are already closed. If you didn't go with a guided tour, it doesn't make much sense. The entrance is 25 TL, free with the museum card.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We crossed the road from Dalyan center with a ferryboat of 4 cars for 20₺. There is an entrance fee of 14₺, but it is free for those who have a museum card. Big and beautiful ancient city. There are hardly any signposts in the ancient city. My advice for those who will go is to set aside at least 2 hours. You can easily see the Iztuzu beach from the top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We came to the ancient city of Kaunos by boat taxis from Dalyan. 2 people round trip is 15₺. Not the way the navigation brings when coming from Marmaris, because it takes too long and we found it wiser to go from Dalyan as we will continue towards Fethiye. Being able to reach the center of Dalyan by boat in 5 minutes was the best part of the day. After the boat, you can reach the city of Kaunos after a 15-minute walk at a fast pace (after entering the village cemetery and seeing it from the best angle). Entry is 14₺ if you don't have a museum card. It's a very large area. I wish it was supported more so that the excavations could continue quickly. We did not take it with us, saying that drones are prohibited, but we saw someone flying a drone inside. The walking distance is actually not very long, but it can be tiring due to the sun. Therefore, I recommend you to wear a hat, bandana and take water with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Closing time seems to be 19.30, but we were not allowed in even though we arrived at 18.00. Information was careless and the treatment shown was not very warm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It took a long time to reach the city. The ancient city area goes down to the lake. However, there is no other structure to see other than the Roman bath, basilica and theatre. In addition, the restoration made to the fountain on the shoreline was a mess. On the other hand, the rock tombs of Kaunos are 1-2 km ahead and you have to go by car. But it was closed when we went. You look so far away. In addition, we will have to use the ferry to the Dalyan side. Get on the ferry, don't go back that way. In general, it was not worth it, but seeing most of the oren places, it would not be possible to come here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is one of the ancient cities that you can go and see, but please read the history before you enter, or you will be content with just watching the stones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The museum card is valid, if not, the entrance is 14 TL per person. Students and children are free. If you take a ferry from the Orange Hotel by car, it would make more sense. The toll is only 20 TL, regardless of the number of people. Cash is paid. Transit time is 15 min. Until. In the meantime, you will cool off a little. There is an area reserved for parking within walking distance to the top. The area to visit is very large. Don't try to go out with slippers. Make sure you have water, towel and hat with you. It's a wonderful place. You can't get enough of watching the scenery, artifacts, etc.. The history and necessary information are already written on the boards, there is no need to write at length. I definitely recommend you to go and see it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There are 2 ways to go to the ancient city of Kaunos.1. The road and the shortest one are from Dalyan by boat and you can reach the city by walking for 2 km from there. But it is very nice to pass through the village and mingle with local products while walking. You can also watch the King Tombs on the hill closely. At the end, you can reach by car from Çandarlı village, but this road is long. The ancient city is partially moderately good. Its theater is still standing upright. Those who are in good condition can go up to the castle on the hill and enjoy the view of the whole delta.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos was the ancient city of three thousand years old. You go through the paid entrance. Museum card is valid. Agora, temple on the left, theater ahead and basilica at the top. There is a bath downstairs. At the bottom, there is a circular structure and a fountain. This area is by the river. I thought it would be better to visit in winter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The most favorite of the ancient cities I have visited so far is the exquisite location and the place where you can get the port city air. The people of Kaunos chose the tenth place. Aunts from Dalyan take you across the river with small boats. Admission is 5 TL. You pass through the village of Candir with a walking distance of about 20 minutes from there and you reach the ancient city. If you wish, you can ride the tractor for 10 TL, but wearing it on foot from the village is like screaming, goat sheep chicken donkey squirrel cat dog cow duck... Especially when the goats greet you of off... there is a way to the king's tomb on the way, but we couldn't enter with the door closed. enough to get seen from the road. There are aunts on the road from time to time, they sell pomegranate orange juice etc. Honey jam..we bought a jam and we liked it. Prices are normal. When you come to the ancient city, watch the goats in the theater and listen, they are everywhere. The architecture of the bath seemed different to us, really nice. As in every ancient city, the work still continues, even the one that does not exist. It would be better if you set aside time in the evening, it's hot. But don't be a match, go even take your coffee in a thermos and go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
In the center of Dalyan, where there is a tea garden and a park, there are boats that cross over, it takes 5TL for a round trip. It can be reached by walking for 20 minutes when you get off across the street. The ancient city is a huge place, I especially recommend going down. There are columnar structures below and there are puddles, you can catch beautiful views.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Although it was an extraordinary place that was not taken care of enough, there was a lot of garbage around. The saddest part is that it has been plundered a lot in the past. Unfortunately not suitable for wheelchair users.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you come from Ortaca, you can go to Dalyan by boat or boat. Sandal prices are 7,5tl round trip and women use these sandals (Maasallah). You are walking. Muzekarr is valid here too. When you come here, take water with you because you will be silent on the way. Aunts from the village are selling honey and pomegranate products on the road. There is an amphitheater here, but I think it is closed. They didn't say it was closed, but they put a barrier on the views. Museum officials are concerned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a super experience. I definitely recommend it, don't pass without seeing it if your way ends up this way. I think you should spare at least three days for sightseeing when you come to Dalyan. There are very special places to visit and you will never forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The men lived in the best places in their time, but they lived very cowardly. It would be great if such places were confiscated before they were looted. Excavation and restoration do not end before 30 years. What kind of logic is that the cafes in these ruins are very expensive and they are not on sale. Take out the museum 🏛 card, it would be much better otherwise very expensive entrances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos Ancient City, located in Dalyan District of Ortaca district of Muğla, was founded by the legendary king Kaunos. Kaunos, which was founded as a Carian city but was exposed to many influences over time, has a 3,000-year history with its rock tombs, bath, agora, ancient theater with a capacity of 5 thousand people and a sacred temple. Kaunos Ancient City in the borders of Çandır Village of Dalyan The ruins you will see in the ancient city, which is on the World Heritage Tentative List, belong to the Roman Period. There are many ruins scattered around. When you climb to the castle of the ancient city, you encounter the magnificent view of the entire delta and Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It may not be the most prominent of the ancient cities spread over a very wide area. But he was one of the leading ones for us. In terms of location, I think those who lived in their time lived well. Here, it can be polished and presented in detail with guides. Although the authorities or museum officials know better. It's like standing in a corner on the shore. I hope it has many visitors. It wasn't there when we went. It was time to go, 4 people came, they were foreigners too. We couldn't travel everywhere. We are determined to see all the places next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You should not expect much for the ancient city ruins in terms of numbers, but you should prefer them in terms of natural beauty and scenery. After crossing from Dalyan with a boat, you first see the rock tombs and then you reach the ancient city by walking for 10-15 minutes. Climb the hill in the ancient city and watch dalyan and iztuzu beach from a bird's eye view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is a boat or road trip from Dalyan to the ancient city. If you have a vehicle, it is better to choose the highway. The road is very smooth and the scenery is beautiful. In addition, there are beautiful gardens where you can make tea & pancakes in the village of Çandarlı, where the ancient city is located. On the way back to Ekincik, you can take a thermal bath in the sea or in Sultaniye. The ancient city does not have a complete surviving structure except the theater, but if you are interested in history, I would definitely recommend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you do not plan to come around the lake with your car, be prepared to walk. If you continue from the side of the river to the end of the road, you will see the tiny boats that cross. The women of Dalyan operate the boats. 5₺ round trip. After crossing the road, you walk 2 km to the left of the road and reach the ruins. You can enter for free with your museum card. Museum entrance is 10 TL. The field is wide. Don't forget to take your water and hat with you. Do not miss the view of the Dalyan river exit from the hill. But going up the hill can be challenging, especially in summer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is one of the rare ancient cities where the ruins are still standing in large structures. You can go by ferryboats that take 2-3 vehicles from Dalyan. It is one of the must-see places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The King Tombs in particular impressed me a lot. Other parts of the ancient city are full of ruins of the kind that we find everywhere in Anatolia. Of course, a more special place for historians and those with a special interest in history. The multitude of exedra, pediments and façades of royal tombs, for example, were unique to this region. Dalyan can be seen with daily boat tours. If you do not have such an opportunity, Dalyan aunts will take you across the street for 5 TL (round trip) per person, in front of the mosque on the Dalyan pier. From here, you can reach Kaunos by walking for about 20 minutes by watching the tombs of the kings. It is quite troublesome in the heat, and even a feeling of regret comes to mind at some point, but there are a couple of aunts selling pomegranate juice and other fruit juices in front of their house on the way, you can buy from them and cool off. The entrance to the ruins is 10 TL, we did not give money to the children. We entered using our museum card feature credit card. If you don't want to see the ancient city (which I don't think is necessary), it is forbidden to go to the tombs of the kings, you can just see it from the opposite side.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is impossible to go to Muğla and not see it. You can see the magnificent history page with your eyes and imagine the life there. It's better to go with someone who knows. We traveled with an English convoy. You can cross the river without waiting at the piers on the edge of the ancient city. You don't have to go back all the way. The river crossing is not in the navigations. Crossing 5 minutes and 15 TL per vehicle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a huge campus. If you want to travel, you need to spare at least 2 hours. There is a royal cemetery and an ancient city. In fact, the place you will visit is a big city. But it's an amazing place. Excavations are still ongoing and I'm sure there will be many more finds. The only thing that bothers me is this: They used the theater area as a wedding and concert venue. I don't need to say anything on this subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
stopped by Dalyan on my way back from the canal tour, especially due to my interest in the nations and states that lived before Christ. It is clear that it is a very big city with its Roman bath, church and theater. It is operated by the Ministry of Culture, the museum card is valid, the entrance is 10 TL (2018);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
To get to the ancient city, you can provide round-trip transportation from dalyan by boat for 5 TL. After crossing the street, you reach the ancient city after 1.5 km of walking path. Museum card is valid at the entrance. If you do not have a museum card, the ticket fee is 10 TL. The ancient city is quite large. Take water with you before you come to the ancient city. Don't forget a hat and glasses in hot weather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
On the way back from the highway, we provided transportation by ferry, but we were officially disgraced on the way. Transportation to such a historical, touristic and sight-seeing place should not be this difficult. The signs are sporadic, it is very difficult to see and follow. The roads are bad and neglected. We paid 14 TL per person for the entrance, which was really unreasonable because there was an entrance without a fence just ahead. You should definitely take water with you, drinking bottled water, especially in the heat of noon. That's why I recommend going in the morning or evening, although I'm not sure about the lighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It can be reached by boat or on foot from Dalyan. Entry is 10.- TL and worth it. Abandoned to its fate, not very well-groomed, sheep and donkeys are roaming inside. If you like historical places, if you feel like they lived centuries ago when you walk in them and touch the stones, it will be perfect for you. There are also beautiful landscapes for those who like to take pictures and selfies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
With its view and location, it will be a magnificent place when it is completely unearthed, but it is in a difficult situation for me right now, such places should not be wasted when there are so many archeology graduates.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
- It can be reached in 5 minutes by car ferry from Dalyan (20₺). You have to go inside the village, but you can't get too close - Museum Card passes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is possible to reach by land, the muzek card is valid. We were lucky to observe the excavation team while they were on the job. In order to get to the castle at the top, you have to go through the paths, we couldn't go up, we went up the hill in the heat of noon. Of course, take the expensive water in the museum market with you. It is also possible to go from Dalyan by ferry. You can't see the rock tombs from here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
With its magnificent structures. It is a magnificent ancient port city that has not received the value it deserves, like our other ancient artifacts built in the Hellenistic order, dating back to the 6th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos, which is one of the most interesting ruins in Turkey with its rock tombs, was a commercially important port city but lost its port feature over time as the sea was filled with alluvium. It rose to number one among the ancient cities I visited. Goat sheep tortoise crab snake etc. in historical texture. We came across a lot of animals. After crossing from Dalyan by boat, you can reach the ancient city with a 2 km walk. You can use muzecard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A place where a civilization known as Kaunos lived. Museum card is valid. There is a WC, a cafeteria. Overnight accommodation is not possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you want to see the photos and videos of this place and many other beautiful places in the surrounding area, you can follow my Instagram account.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is necessary to cross from Dalyan by ferry or boat, it is closer this way. The entrance fee is 14 TL, you can enter with a museum card. There are ruins of a church, bath, amphitheater, fountain, etc. You are traveling with goats. It would be better if you take water with you, otherwise it is difficult in the heat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We visited on May 20, 2022. On the Akyaka-Fethiye road, we deviated from the first sign and crossed a forest road of 45-50 minutes. I think there is a shorter route on Dalyan that I realized later. The forest road was very enjoyable for me. We reached Kaunos by wandering around Köyceğiz lake. If you enjoy visiting ancient cities, you should definitely see them. Museum card is valid. In a mystical atmosphere, you can feel the richness of history extending to the present and calmly sail to emotions you have never experienced. The most impressive photo for me was the area where the land and the lake meet on the south coast of the city. It was fascinating.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
found it a bit neglected and left to itself. Apart from that, entrances are 25 TL per person, there is a place to take a rest and an ice cream and soft drink area. It is quite long, and the end goes down to the lake. It can be a little difficult with the child, so we did not go down. But it would be very nice to go down to the lakeside and watch the scenery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
To reach the ancient city of Kaunos, instead of using the highway, it is an easier choice to go to the center of Dalyan and take a ferry. Because going directly to the ancient city by road can be a bit tiring. After visiting the ancient city, it has a very small cafe with a seating area under the trees, where you can take a coffee break and take a breather. Water is very expensive and you will go in the summer months, it is useful to bring your water with you. It is a beautiful and must-see ancient city founded by Kaunos, the son of Miletus King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
When we went to Dalyan, I was curious and went, but it is not worth your time and tiredness. If you have time, you can climb the castle. The road is very steep, but I am sure that the view is worth it. They sell pomegranate juice on the road, you must try it, the taste is still in my mouth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is difficult to reach compared to other ancient cities. To cross the river, you need to take the small ferry with 3 vehicles. Crossing takes 2-3 minutes. The toll is 23₺. After passing, you reach the city without going 1 km. Excavations are still going on inside. There are fountains, agora, basilica, bath and theater in the ruins dating from the 5th century BC. Those who do not come as someone who has visited other ancient cities will not lose much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The breakfast is varied and delicious. It is also very enjoyable to have breakfast with a view of the Kaunos Rock Tombs. Catch one of the waterside tables;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can reach one of the perfect ancient cities of our heavenly homeland after a bit of troublesome transportation and you will be alone with perfect ruins and perfect history. Please, let's not throw our garbage on the ground, please KEEP OUR ENVIRONMENT CLEAN. Make sure to set aside 3 hours for sightseeing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Excavations have been going on since 1960. The state of Kayra was established here as a port city in the years of Jesus Christ, and then the Persian empire settled on it, and later the Roman and Byzantine empires settled and lived here. There are remains from these 4 ancient states, and there are remains from these 4 ancient states, and an ancient ambassador in iztuzu, whose iztuzu leans on the slope of Dalyan. at the point where the Aegean and the Mediterranean meet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A little difficult to reach, had to use the ferry. Cute donkeys were roaming the streets of the ancient city. Muza card is valid.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is no parking lot. If it is convenient, 3 4 vehicles can be parked on the side of the road. Do not go without sneakers and water. Museum card is valid. Entry is 25 TL. A large site.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It has a very beautiful image, if you are passing through Dalyan, do not miss it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You should go by canoe from Köyceğiz lake to Iztuzu beach and even to the turtle hospital. If you say you can't go, don't miss the boat tours. A nice place;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you like historical places, I would say definitely go, the only problem I see is that there is no information about heaps around, other than that, a very nice walk and great history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
In order to be in a very beautiful historical atmosphere, it must be on your holiday route. It is wonderful with its view and nature. However, the staff is cold and uninformed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Be careful with the snake, it has a very beautiful view, go up and see the view. You go up 152 meters. The snake appears 152 meters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Well maintained, far below expectations. The works have not been preserved. Not as interesting as the rock tombs. Entrance is 20 ₺ . teacher and student are free . Be sure to wear sports shoes;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you are interested in ancient cities, you can visit. Otherwise, you won't have much to lose. It's a little neglected. It may be good to walk in the early morning or evening. Don't forget to take plenty of drinks, a hat and sunscreen with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is 1 km walking distance, 25 TL entrance fee, museum card is valid, I recommend you to come and see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The place where the ruins of the ancient Carian city of Kaunos are located has the most beautiful location to see Dalyan. You should definitely visit the ancient city and take the most beautiful pictures of Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You are officially wondering how ancient civilizations lived in these lands thousands of years ago. Fountain in the port, theatre, bath, church. Although most of it has been destroyed, what remains is quite impressive. Donkeys and goats accompany you throughout the trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The city is beautiful, but transportation is a bit difficult. If you are in dalyan, you can come across with the car ferry. The theater was closed when I went. I want to visit again in the future;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A ruined place that will be very beautiful when the restoration and excavation works are completed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Magnificent works greet you with its structures and water and sewer infrastructures far ahead of the period, the ancient theater, ancient fountain and many other works of art, which have been unearthed with a calculation, open the doors of history to you until the end. In order to go to the ancient city of Kaunos from Dalyan, you have to walk for about 2 km after crossing by boat (5 TL per person round trip) in front of the Kaunos tea garden of Ortaca municipality. When you come to Dalyan, you should definitely set aside time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a lovely ancient city that you can visit with a nice 2 km walk. Pleasant road, breezy air, beautiful view is worth a visit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a great campus, but you need to work hard soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooto to it seems impossible to get to the castle on the hill, there is no way when it comes to transportation! After saying the graves and finally Iztuzu beach, it takes about 3 hours. When you return, you get in your car and go to the ancient city of Kaunos, there will be at least 2 hours of sightseeing, arrange your time well, take your honey from the village roads and go to your hotel on the way back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It was very nice to see historical places, we paid 25 TL per person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is very difficult to come by car and go over the hard roads, but we came in antiquity, but every part of it is destroyed and its history is not claimed, and the entrance fee is 10 TL. WCs are not allowed to enter because of bad smell. Also, the water at the entrance to the museum is 5 TL. They established a black market, but they are not claimed in the ancient city. 1969, a few of the excavations discovered in 2005. it has come to the sky but maybe tens or hundreds of times have not come to the surface. It is officially disrespectful to the past for them to enter the open air museum with a tractor and transport the tourists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Relatively well preserved, one of the great cities of its time, where excavations are still ongoing; It is one of the ancient cities that should be seen due to its location and natural beauty.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Now we went down to the city to take pictures with donkeys and goats. If you are not very keen on archeology, it is not worth going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An ancient city with an Arena for 5000 people. It is possible to cross from Dalyan in 5 minutes with a small car ferry. Vehicle price is 15 TL. You can enter the ancient city with a museum card.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
From places that preserve their natural texture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's very hot here, we're in July. So set your arrival time well. We pass from Dalyan with 5 TL per person one way, and you go up a light hill for 15 minutes. The road is not a path, it is a driveway under the sun. Under the trees at the ruins are a place to sit for a long time and look at the history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a place that doesn't have many visitors. All the staff members are friendly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is definitely a place to go and see, history is calling you, not to mention its beauty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city of Kaunos, famous for its rock tombs, was a commercially important port city, but lost its port feature over time as the sea was filled with alluvium. The acropolis, which forms the heart of the city, is built on a hill at a height of 152 meters. The theater with 33 rows of seats is located at the foot of the acropolis. One of the building remains in the west of the theater belongs to a basilica type church, while the other remains in the city are the remains of the Roman bath and the temple. The rock tombs, which can also be seen from Dalyan, were built in IV. It was built in the 19th century and was later used in the Roman period. The cavities carved into the rocks, which can be seen from the pier, are the places where giant fires are lit, which act as beacons for the ships docking at the ancient port to transport cargo to Kaunos. According to Herodotus, the father of history, the people of Caunos were from the indigenous people of Caria, but they considered themselves Cretans. The geographer Strabo also writes that Kaunos has a shipyard and a port that can be closed. The port of the city was Sülüklü Göl below the acropolis. At that time, the sea was reaching the acropolis of Kaunos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Bring your water, etc., while the stadium is being renovated, the cafeteria is 8 liras.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Definitely a must see place full of history intertwined with different times;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I think I went in the wrong season, donkeys, goats and I was there, the waterways are still working. The road with land access is very dusty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A wonderful place to visit, an ancient city to see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city is worth seeing, the entrance fee is 10 TL, 250ml water is 5 TL, for the first time in my life they asked for 5 TL for small water, I'm shocked whoever determines these prices, take a drink with you, there is not much shade, the sun will be on your head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I think it's a place to meet. Only I went on the Dalyan tour boat. Our people visit such places as stones. But it's not like that, go and see. Do not forget that all the historical artifacts found here are exhibited in the city museum in Fethiye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is no order to go around and the ruins are scattered. There are only some finds and clues of previous civilizations that have not yet been built as a city. However, no comprehensive study has been done. The entrance is 14 TL and when you come from the beach by boat, you walk to the area for 10 minutes. It's a tough trail that goes upwards in the heat. Especially if you come from the sea salty. Hats, glasses, water, sunscreen are a must in summer. May not be good with children over 65 years old. There is a passenger transportation system that is used only on a contractual basis. Tourists went upstairs with it, but we couldn't use it. 5 6 better times to visit in the summer, tickets are issued until 7 and closes at 8 pm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
To go here, you first have to go to Dalyan. You arrive here after a short but pleasant boat ride and walking two and a half kilometers on the village road. You enter the ruins from the gravel road. If you do not have a museum card, there is a fee of 17.5 TL. It's quite a large place. There are places such as churches, theaters and temples inside. However, the coffee shop at the entrance is quite expensive. We paid 27 TL for two Turkish coffees, even though the museum gave the card half a discount. The coffees also came in a small cardboard box.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A wonderful ancient city is a must-see. Entrance is 10TL. You can also enter with a museum card.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a beautiful ancient city that should be visited during cool hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You should not come to Dalyan and not return without seeing it. About 1 hour is sufficient for the sightseeing route. However, if you want to go up to the castle on the hill, you have to spend more time. The castle road may be a bit tiring, but the view is beautiful. If you do not have a museum card, the entrance fee is 17.50 TL as of January 2022.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is such a place where history and nature are intertwined that one hill sees the lake, the other one is insatiable to see the sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I would recommend it to history lovers. It's a great historical city, but either go in the morning or it gets very hot in the evening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
can say that it is a place that can be visited in Muğla Fethiye. He seemed a little indifferent because of his distance. An area where you can easily see animals such as goats, donkeys, turtles and squirrels, it is a visible place, but it is 40 km away from Köyceğiz and its winding roads make you wonder if it is worth this beauty. I actually went for the Tombs of the Kings but I could only see it from afar and that was a disappointment for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We passed by Sandalla across the town of Dalyan. Duration is 5 minutes, round trip is 20 TL. On the opposite beach, there is a 2 km walk in nature, there is no slope on the road. In the last 100 meters, you go up a little hill and reach the entrance of the city. The ancient city is beautiful, but the walking path is also very nice if the weather is not hot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city and royal tombs were impressive;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is an excellent cultural treasure, which we entered as a small place, but encountered a very large and gigantic ancient city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It was huge. The museum clerk was very knowledgeable. It was there that they told us about the Muzekart application for the first time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos is the city of the Persians. You should definitely see the rock tombs. Then go to the Iztuzu beach. It is a region with carats and blue crabs. Very nice sand and shallow beach. Egg laying time is coming more. I recommend seeing and eating blue crabs. Meat is delicious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Don't have high expectations, if you're passing over the road, you can stop by and visit the lake, the view is very beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is still standing and with its magnificent position, it makes you feel like you can't get out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ancient cities have always attracted my attention. The seaside, especially the castle walls, theater areas. The period they were built and the craftsmen who made them and the architectural features of the period are very beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You feel yourself in that period, you will arrive in 15 minutes after the ferry and boat crossing from Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Visiting more than 15 ancient cities in the last year, this one is a bit pale compared to the others. The theater, bath, Byzantine church are beautiful. Excavations continue. If you are near Dalyan or Köyceğiz, travel if the weather is not too hot. Free with the museum card.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ekincike is a must-see if you happen to be on your way, but the roads can be a bit of a hassle. The roads are very winding.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Roman architecture and Hellenistic architecture are active. The climb to the castle is challenging but worth the view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ancient city dating back to 6 AD. Its 5000-seat theater, mosaics and altar are worth seeing. The view is beautiful. You can reach it by boat, by taking the ferry, by car or in a tractor trailer. Entry to the ruins for 2019: 14 TL, primary school students free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
didn't go into the city. I only saw the graves from afar. But it is definitely worth seeing for those who love historical places. The photos I added belong to the graves. The city is a little further away, so don't be deceived.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The date is history, but there is no careless freak order, entrance 17 ₺, you should pass from dalyan with a vehicle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a place to visit with curiosity despite the heat of August. I recommend you to buy drinks etc. in your expensive backpack at the entrance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you want a different experience on the mini ferry, one of the rare places where history and nature meet, you can take a boat tour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is not much of a building worth seeing, maybe it will be manageable when the renovations are finished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The excavations are not finished yet, but it must be seen, the ancient theater is under repair, it cannot be visited, other places are open.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An amazing place. Everyone should definitely visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
must-see place in the evening, when you are looking at the royal tombs, a surprise visitor may come to you, you can come across with a beautiful route with a boat tour. By the way, the reeds blew too much, it is very ugly to wash them with pressurized water in mud baths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient theater is in really good condition. It is recommended. Must go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Visiting places that reflect history gives a different taste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Take your water with you 0.5 ml of water 7₺ and don't go with a baby carriage, a room with limited space will be a burden on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There could have been more explanatory signs, and the prices in the buffet at the exit are very expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I recommend a suitable place for hiking worth seeing. I say go across Dalyan with a boat;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
This is a place that smells of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is very difficult to reach. Travel boats reach within the tour. or from Dalyan by boat for 5TL (2017 price). You have to reach the ancient city by walking from here. Or there is a tractor transportation for 5TL one way. The theater is partially standing in the ancient city. There is nothing else. I wouldn't recommend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The current state, which has not been fully excavated, is not worth seeing, but if excavations are made in the future, it will be worth seeing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I strongly recommend that you bring water to drink with you when you go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I don't know why it's a supernatural beauty, but when you visit this place, you feel a sense of peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can visit this Lycian settlement with the boats you can board from Dalyan. It has a really beautiful view and it's a big campus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
So beautiful place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can park your car a little far away and reach it on foot. It is a city built on a very large area and you have to go up and down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The museum card is valid.. The ruins on the left side of the entrance are closed.. There are some ruins on the lower side.. The ancient theater has survived a little.. There are wall ruins on the hill.. If you continue to the king tombs, it is closed.. King tombs are not allowed.. You cross the ferry with your vehicle and continue...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can enter with a museum card. It's a little hard to come by. You will either go around Köyceğiz with your car for more than 1 hour or you will cross the road with a ferry, which is more logical. Since we have children spread over a very large area, we could not visit the lower parts, we only visited the upper parts. We have not seen any work that has not been done on an unmaintained ancient city. Still, I think it's worth going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Entrance is 17.50 TL for those who have a museum card. The museum card can also be bought from the entrance point for 60 TL. If you are interested in historical places, you can visit all the places for free for 1 year by paying 60 TL. If we come to Kaunos, it is worth a visit. You will cross the mountain in a short time. The ferry fee is 23 TL per vehicle, it takes about 3-5 minutes to cross.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can go to Çandır either by car or on foot by the tiny ferry from Dalyan. There are also sandals to cross. Located within the borders of Çandır village, the ancient city of Kaunos was an important commercial port city in Antiquity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a place that is only a small example of the unique historical and cultural richness of my beautiful country, but we have a historical weakness as a nation, I think that we cannot pay enough attention to cultural heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city is beautiful, but unfortunately the direction and information signs are very lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is in a very difficult place in terms of location, but it has a magnificent view that is worth the difficulty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
except for the bad roads, enjoyable informed time can be spent;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Spread over a large area, a beautiful must-see place;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a beautiful place, but the surroundings are very neglected. There are not enough signposts on the road. You come all the way to the bottom of the area and you wonder where to enter here, where to park the car. Let me give you important information for those who will come from Dalyan by car. I learned that there are ferry services between Dalyan and Kaunos after 60 km from the highway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
For those without a car: Walk along the river until you come across the tombs of the kings. You will see the sandals. The female friend will take you across (7.5 TL go and come) and will describe the 2 km locked cobblestone road. If you walk at a time when the sun's rays come with oblique pains, you will proceed in the shade of the trees. It's a pleasure to watch. The signs are enough to get you there. When you get close, you reach the ancient city from 100m of land.. (Get lots of water and pomegranate juice from the aunts by the roadside). Have a shoe suitable for all terrains.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Nice place for those who care about ancient ruins. But it doesn't appeal to me;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A place to visit with ample time;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Only 30 percent of it has been exposed yet. If you have a museum, don't forget to take it with you. The entrance fee is 17.50 TL. It is the most logical way to get there by ferry with 3 cars from the center of Dalyan. At least 2 hours are required to visit comfortably and enjoy it. There are theaters, baths, fountains, churches etc. There are places to see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can reach the must-see places after a short walk by crossing the boat from the sea instead of using the highway for transportation. The walking path and the pleasant scenery are worth seeing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Getting lost in history and in the forest. It is impossible to come to Dalyan and not see it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
“A divine city” for those who want a short summary. Since we did not have a short time (to avoid being a little hot), we entered close to the sunset. I think there were two entrances, we entered from the back and parked right next to the turnstiles. There are boutique state affiliates in museums such as a small cafe at the entrance, and there are beautiful works such as a Roman bath, a church, a holy stalagmite at the top. All of them were impressive, but when they passed the passage and started to descend the stairs, it was as if BC. You feel as if you are going back to the years, enormous structures, architecture fascinates you. I don't know if we had gone at noon, maybe we wouldn't have been so impressed, but while we were walking around, our chins were hanging down to our knees. We captured some great poses (unfortunately I can't post them here). You should definitely visit this ancient city. Even if you bring it to the sunset, you will understand what I mean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"We passed by ferry from Dalyan. If your car is close to the ground, do not go to the entrance, leave your car under the olive trees opposite the entrance. The entrance was 17 TL in August. Free for teachers. The ancient city is very beautiful, but unfortunately it has been neglected. One scene of the movie ""My Ice Cream Cream"" was shot in the ancient theater. It is beneficial for those who come to Dalyan to stop by.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's hard to travel in the heat to benefit from your Müzekart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Everywhere in this ancient heritage is unfortunately full of animal droppings. I went 2 days in a row. Not cleaned, smells and no maintenance. The animals were told they couldn't close the passage but at least the mess must be cleaned up. It needs to be taken care of immediately. In addition, there should be Turkish translation plates next to the stones written on -I think in Greek-, if their language can be deciphered. People wonder what he wrote. An ancient city doomed to its own fate... I'm so sorry. Not enough attention is paid to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Definitely a place not worth visiting. Admission is 17.50 TL. No statues etc. Everything was destroyed and looted. You can't see anything but a pile of stones. There is no means of transportation. It is not possible to walk on the stones on the ground. Even the mosaics rise on unprotected people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city of Dalyan is on the must-see list after seeing the splendor of the king's tombs. It is a large city and the theater is particularly well preserved. The mosaics behind the church are another proof that the same patterns were used in all Anatolian lands. Only the entrance was a bit of a surprise, as if the wires were cut, you can reach the real entrance above when you say that we are entering a leak. Don't be misled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A place that must be seen and smells of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A wonderful corner from my paradise country. The combination of nature, history and perfect scenery;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Miletos expelled his son, and his son Kaunos made a grave for himself on the steep surface of the mountain out of fear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The roads are very bad, the business is very bad. It doesn't go that far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
When the restoration and excavation works progress, it will be a much more beautiful ancient city. I think the part on the shore of the lake is much more beautiful, even as it is. The ancients know their business;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
amazing place a history to go and see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Make sure to visit these places, wonderful nature, beauty, forest, sea, greenery..amazing..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You go to the ancient city of Kaunos with the boaters in the Kaunos Tea Garden in the center of Dalyan, for a round trip fee of 7.5 liras, with a 20-minute village road walk. Other options are to take the car ferry and go by car, start walking by watching the king tombs and admiring the walkway. a couple of villagers sell cold pomegranate juice etc. Also, the branches of fig/pomegranate trees hang down on the road. Take one or two from them and continue to eat them. There is an opuntia type cactus that produces the fruit we call prickly figs. You can also get prickly figs from it, but beware of thorns and burning hairs! The entrance to the ancient city of Kaunos is 17.5 lira, the museum card is valid, there is the church and mosaics on the left at the first entrance, the magnificent amphitheater, the view from the theater is magnificent, you cannot climb the castle, it's dangerous! After the theater, you look at the round structure on the road parallel to the place you came from, and then you go to the agora-fountain-temple part by stairs from the floor like the door ahead. I sat and watched the scenery, I thought about what the people of that place were doing in the theater in that temple on those roads, I learned who the kings/leaders were and tried to imagine, it is a very impressive place, take a look at the last ruins of the bath, look at the drawing showing the whole state of the bath in detail and admire the magnificent architecture, engraved as one of the places where I was impressed...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
For transportation to the area, you can cross the Dalyan Bosphorus by boat by paying 14 TL round trip fee for two people from Dalyan. After you pass, the royal tombs greet you, and you can reach the area after walking for 20 minutes by following this road. I recommend you to read the history and go, it has a wonderful ambiance. I do not recommend climbing the walls to the east of the ancient theater. As of September 2020, if you do not have a museum card, the entrance fee is 14 TL.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"It is forbidden to enter the ancient city because it was written 6 years ago. that evening""";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great place to see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I can say that it has the most developed city structure among the ancient cities I have visited. There is not much left of the city. When you travel through history when your imagination combines with the ruins, you will realize that it is one of the most beautiful places to live. The nature is wonderful, bring your museum card and come;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ruins of Kaunos are worth seeing with its unique location and natural texture. You will travel back in time among the ruins of the port city. The theater of the city at the top, the temples, the fountain below, and the agora and the harbor street at the bottom. To see the whole view, it is necessary to climb the terrace temple or the hill on which the theater leans. The view from above is beautiful and makes for great photos for your memories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The beauty of the amphitheater cannot be described. You have to be in that atmosphere. I say don't miss it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is difficult to find the entrance to the ancient city, they made a very small sign. The entrance is very bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peaceful place to see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
THANK YOU TO THE MINISTRY OF CULTURE AND ALL THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS WHO CARRIED HISTORY TO THE PRESENT EXCAVATIONS THAT WERE EXTENSIVELY A CITY OF THAT TIME IS A HUGE AREA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It goes back 3,000 years, must see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Visible but not superb...restoration and excavation are poor;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Prices are a bit expensive otherwise no problem;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I have visited many ancient cities so far. It was one of the places where I was most impressed. It was pretty quiet due to the pandemic. There were puddles in certain areas in March. In that way, he added a different magic to himself. You can also go from Dalyan by boat. You can also go around Köyceğiz Lake by car. We went by car and the views of Köyceğiz Lake on the road were also excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A beautiful ancient city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I wonder how the natural look will be when the maintenance and repair is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is possible to go from Dalyan by boat tour or by boat. After crossing the street, there is an average of 1 km uphill walking distance. It is not a suitable choice for lunch hours, it is a difficult journey. If you do not have a museum card, you can enter the ancient city for 14 TL. After you enter, the signpost greets you. After that, it is entirely up to you, I think that the necessary care is not taken. There is a ban on climbing to the king's tombs, there are people who go out, of course, but it is said that it is risky. There was a mention of broken rocks. On the hill almost behind the ancient theater there is a wall like a castle wall, I don't know if it's free to climb there or not, it has a very steep slope. I would like to see the view from there;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A magnificent ancient city with its amphitheater built on a hill overlooking Dalyan Bay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a must visit place. As I walked there, I felt as if I lived here centuries ago. Its incredible architectural features also amaze people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Transportation is seriously troublesome and it is difficult to find someone who gives information about this issue in Dalyan. Let me try to explain to you. If you are going with your own vehicle, you can take a 3-car ferry departing in front of Dalyan Orange Hotel. I was told to walk the 1.5 km road to make the crossing (I couldn't find that boat). Good thing I couldn't find it. You have to walk for an average of 20-25 minutes under the heat. If you don't have a museum card for the entrance to the ancient city, it's seriously difficult to walk around under the sun for 14₺. Why isn't there a guide anywhere? I don't know. I wish Muğla municipality would put a guide and give little information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I recommend those who have fallen on the way to visit it for a journey into history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We knew that Dalyan went with different options. However, we chose to go by Köyceğiz by wandering around Köyceğiz Lake and watching the magnificent view in order not to risk our trip due to February, which is the off-season. .Kaunos Ancient City is one of the places to visit. The only problem is that the prices of the buffet at the entrance are way too expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's not very hot, but it's worth seeing, the roads are pretty boring. We came from the planter, the road problems, the way of the sheep is very narrow;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city entrance road is narrow, there is no parking lot, you park your car on the side of the road and go up the stony road towards the ancient city, there is a mini ferry in Dalyan down the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The historical city is really impressive but the buildings are very lacking. Many are almost exclusively ground. However, the work continues. Regardless, I would recommend a business trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a large ancient city spread over a wide area within walking distance to the mountain where the Kaunos King tombs are located in the Dalyan region. You can reach it by walking 1-1.5 km by crossing the boat from Dalyan. It would be better not to visit, especially at noon. Because the hot weather is quite challenging. Its church, ancient theatre, agora, bath and settlements have survived to the present day. The entrance fee is 14 TL. You can also enter with a museum card. Sandal fee is 7.5 TL. History buffs should definitely see it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"The ancient city of Kaunas is a fascinating place. As far as I can see, the only restored place is the theater. Although there is the rest. It has been cleaned a little, its streets are open... It is worth seeing even in this state. You can go on tours or you can go to the opposite shore from the center of Dalyan by boat and walk. There is a place on your way that makes very good pancakes and ayran. You can chat with the villagers who sell their products on the road. If you are going on foot, go early in the morning or towards the evening. Pay attention to the air temperature. Have an umbrella or a hat and water. Although, there is a spring near the Rock Tombs on the road. We used to go to the rock tombs and see them. Last time we went, they fenced it off and put ""dangerous"" warnings. If you say ""three-five rocks"" to such ruins";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
historical place to visit in Dalyan. You can cross from Dalyan by boat (7.5 TL round trip) and then continue on foot, (there are ferries in vehicles). Entrance fee to the ancient city is 15 TL.;"try the hot springs.""";https://www.google.com.tr/none;none;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Old campus built on top of the mountain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We took the ferry from Ortaca to the Kaunos region in 5 minutes. Getting on and off the ferry is very difficult. They place 4 cars at the bottom. Entry and exit areas are narrow. There are many vehicles waiting. You are under stress. There is a wall behind, the officials warn that there is a car, but in vain. I will never go again. If you don't want to go by ferry, you have to go 80 km by land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient king tombs of Kaunos are worth seeing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
KAUNOS CASTLE, DALYAN CHANNELS TEARS OF VEBYBLISApollon's son becomes the twins of Miletos, King of Caria. The man is called Kaunos and the girl is called Byblis.\Byblis falls in love with Kaunos. byblis;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I'm sure it would be much more useful to know about its history before going to such places. It is a good example to see how ancient civilizations lived. Make sure to go down to the beach. Goats and donkeys became owners of the place. I recommend not to go in the summer day at noon. Be sure to have water with you and the energy to go back uphill. Entry fee is 14 TL, children under 18 are free.;He establishes the city named after himself. Byblis, on the other hand, wanted to end his life because of his unrequited love.;Throws himself off a high rock. But Nymphs (nymphs) take pity on Byblis and turn it into a spring. Byblis' tears become rivers, ages stop.;https://www.google.com.tr/none;none;;;;;;;;;;;;
An ancient city with a beautiful view. I'm sure it will be more beautiful when the works are completed;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Impressive..an ancient city;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It should definitely be seen when it comes to Dalyan. You can go not only to see the ancient city but also to see the view. Unfortunately, due attention was not paid to the ancient city, and the excavations were in place for a long time. There isn't even enough descriptive information about the ruins. Since it will be very hot in the summer, it may be more comfortable to go towards the evening, and it can also be an opportunity to watch the sunset. Entrance fee is 10 TL, museum card is valid. They sell water inside for 5 liras.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's definitely a place to come and see. About 4 hours passed while we were walking around, we saw the tombs in the excavations, each stone has a separate date, and we looked at it secretly, even if it was covered 🤗;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
made a trip to many places for the Fethiye holiday we came to in August. This was one of the places we were curious about and we had the opportunity to stop by. First of all, if you come to the riverside of Dalyan by car and pass by boat, you have to walk 1 km uphill to the ancient city. If you come by car, there are small ferries that pass them across. The ancient city is beautiful and well-maintained, the entrance fee is reasonable, and there is a resting area etc.. Everything has been thought of. A must see place. I advise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a very beautiful place worth seeing, but if you go from Dalyan to a place between Köyceğiz and Dalyan, you should cross the river and walk for 15-20 minutes. On the other hand, it is a little far from the car. If you go, take plenty of cold water with you, don't go out without a hat. My wife and I were pretty fried. There are places on the road that sell pomegranate and orange juice. Pomegranate gardens, fig trees as much as possible, the natural environment is wonderful, actually, there is no need to explain 😁 if you have a maximum credit card with museum fee, it's free (it's good for a museum card, it worked 😂) otherwise, if I remember correctly, you pay a fee of 20 TL. I didn't go into the details much since I passed for free 🙈😹 I was very sorry that I didn't take a picture in the ancient theater, but it was so hot that I took my breath away. Long story short, go 😹 see the fish and go to the ancient city of Kaunos😊;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you are interested in history, you must see it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
place to go for those who love historical places. but unfortunately, there is also the classical goat voting of the ruins here. It's hard to travel in very hot weather. There are places like theatre, Turkish bath etc. at the top are the ramparts. You can exit the trails. but a bit difficult. Entry is 14 TL. Free under 18. there is a place like a buffet, wc, sitting area;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I recommend you to see the king tombs and the ancient city;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It does not satisfy anyone who has seen Ephesus and aphrodisias, do not come in vain;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos King Cemetery, located in Ortaca region of Muğla, is also referred to as Dalyan Rock Tombs in some sources. These tombs are thought to belong to kings. The powerful and magnificent tombs created by carving into the mountains also reflect the power of the ancient city in a sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The historical texture of the landscape is beautiful, but the landscaping is not done. Entry is 14 TL, children and teachers are free. Iztuzu view looks great. My advice is to take the ferry from Dalyan by car. If you get on the ferry on foot, you will have to go uphill. It is difficult in the heat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Do not go with small children. It's very hot in the summer and you have to walk a bit. There is a buffet next to the church. This. Ice cream and there. The view is beautiful towards the lake;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the must-see ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The seaside was also a very nice trade destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Location information is incorrect; It was written as Ortaca/Koycegiz and the location was specified as Ortaca again. Köyceğiz and Ortaca are both separate districts of Muğla province and the ancient city of Kaunos is within the borders of Çandır Neighborhood of Köyceğiz District. In summary, the mention of Kaunos with Dalyan consists of the fact that Dalyan sees Kaunos from the opposite side.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
really liked the ancient city. It just might be a little difficult to get around. If you are in Dalyan, you have to cross the river by ferry. My advice is to switch to 20 liras with your car. There is a little slope up to the ancient city and it is hot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can reach Dalyan by small car ferry (easier) or by car (more difficult) by circumnavigating Köyceğiz Lake. The ruins are relatively well preserved and spread over a wide area. There is a very beautiful view from the hill to the Dalyan Strait. If you walk down, you can reach the reeds and the waterfront. Don't leave without seeing this place, it's a really nice experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"It is a very beautiful ancient city that must be visited. but when we asked for information at the entrance and how far the area extends, we got the answer, ""Walk and see as much as you can,"" there is a really interesting museum staff. and the way is really hard. You can come by car via Köycegiz. On the way back, you can take the ferry to the Dalyan side for 20 TL and continue.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Perfect place historical nature;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It has a magnificent beauty, first you cross the river by boat (5TL and free until 10 years old) then 1-1.5 km uphill walk, entrance to the hill area (12 TL and free until 10 years old). The buildings need restoration and strengthening as they do everywhere in Turkey. At the same time, excavations should continue in this area. The ancient theater is exactly the same as the ancient theater of Patara, its atmosphere and acoustics are excellent. Due to its location in a dominant place, it has a magnificent view. It should be added to the list of absolute must-see places before you die.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a very beautiful ancient city, but unfortunately it has been neglected. You need to set aside 2-3 hours to visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I think it would be good if it was put in the background with more funding and work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
While you are in Dalyan, you should go to the other side of the river and see the ancient city. When you get to the opposite side, it is necessary to walk for 1 km, but it is a beautiful ancient city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A wonderful ancient city. One feels at that time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Today I went all the way to the front, entered from the top first, parked the car under the tree. A sign in front of me says please buy a ticket. I looked around, there is no place to buy tickets, there are 3-5 men sitting 100 MT ahead and looking at me. Anyway, I said, I guess there is another entrance. I went back, went down, the small sign says Kaunos. I said, this cannot be the entrance, there is a dusty slope that is not maintained, there is no place to park the car around. I pressed it before I went in. To eat something down by the river. I went to a cafe and ate something, I said, there was an ancient city called Kaunos, what a place, the locals said; a neglected place is not worth going at all, they charge 10₺, and there is a fountain at the top, most of them are visible from there.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The bath structure is very well preserved. I have visited many ancient cities so far, and these were the ones that impressed me the most. A must see place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
History is history, it is absolutely wonderful, but very neglected goats and cows are traveling, and the roads are pretty bad and if you enter far, you should definitely go by making your road plan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An ancient city with a unique view that I visited after a tiring tour. Climbing that hill is no different from military training, especially with children. But the view at the top is worth it, the ancient civilizations and the incredible structures they built. I look at both the buildings and nature with amazement. I am jealous of those people. The friend at the gate is very helpful and smiling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
They couldn't make a proper city arrangement, it causes you to travel around the city very scattered and there are many places you miss, and the company in the business does not provide any service other than ripping people off. In addition, you need to use a ferry for transportation and you find it difficult to get to the city with insufficient signage, especially from the city center. Crossing by ferry with a car go and come 40 without a car go and come 10 TL If you go without a car, you can walk for about 15 minutes after the ferry and reach the city that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I do not recommend you to go in the summer, it is very hot, but it is worth seeing. Entrance fee is 15 20 TL per person. Under 18 years old free.1 Coke 10 TL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"have always loved historical places. It is a relatively preserved ancient city. The general outlines of each building remain. Also, mountain goats and squirrels will accompany you while you travel. The view is also very beautiful. The royal tombs seen in the photograph are not in this city area, but you can see them. There are some scattered iron images. But this unfortunately exists in all ancient cities in our country. I think the ministry or the relevant people should be sensitive about this. Let me give you a hint. If you go after 18:00, you can visit for free;) Unfortunately, the road to reach here is ancient. I hope it is edited";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is one of the most beautiful ancient cities in the world, but there is hardly any information sign, you are traveling without learning anything. The easiest way to reach Dalyan is by ferry after a little while. Ferry price is 10 TL for passenger car.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
This kind of historical place lovers must see;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The tractor service between the village and the ancient city is very infrequent as the density is low, so we had to wait, but the ruins are very beautiful. The ancient tombs also look beautiful, but it seems impossible to go up, the doors are locked and there is no proper way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Absolutely magnificent. A must see place. On the way, we crossed the small ferry. It was a very different experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We toured today. 14tl per person. When we entered, we lost ourselves for hours without getting bored. Travel everywhere. We went with our own vehicle. The road is a bit long but worth it. From there we went to Ekincik beach. Ekincik is busy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A great place to see before you die. You can swim in the ancient city. And you will probably never forget this beach like me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's like a place where attention was paid for a certain period of time, and then it was said, never mind. Information about the buildings is insufficient.. It is a place that is not easy to visit.. But it is worth seeing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A historical place worth seeing. If you don't want to walk in the heat, you should take the ferry by car and cross the street.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Transportation by private car is very comfortable, only the entrance fee at the door is 12 TL. It seems a bit high. While visiting the ancient city, you must be a guide, otherwise you will look at the stones and turn around, the illuminating plate is very low. It has a calming energy and atmosphere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
In Dalyan, you cross the boat at the very end of the boats. 5 TL round trip. Then you walk for 10-15 minutes, passing the rock tombs. It's a large area. It takes about 1-2 hours to walk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a paradise on earth. There are two ferries from Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
little neglected, not given the necessary attention, but I liked the location, nature, view very much. I had no trouble with the mysterious round-trip land, the roads are on a well-maintained road, wonderful nature, lake and sea view;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You pay for the boat to cross the sea and also for the entrance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Whether you come from Ekincik or by ferry from Dalyan, you go to the same gate. If I said door, don't think of the ancient city entrance door. An old door and a sign saying kaunos and a slope that does not look like a road await you, but when you come from the pier, a road to the left without any signage leaves 500 meters after this door, why this road? There is no sign on the door, I don't understand, I guess they want people to walk uphill. If we come to the city, I couldn't see anything, in fact, there is a lot of things, but there is no maintenance and work, there is not even an information brochure at the entrance, we visited the area in the middle because we had children, and the most important structure there is the theater, by the way, the theater has a right entrance, don't use the stairs that are under renovation. You wouldn't have lost anything if you didn't see the neglected stones in the theater, they moved and trees came out of the stones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Museum card is valid. Not very interesting. King tombs are already visible from the center of Dalyan. There is no departure from the ancient city. You can cross by car ferry. If you are an antique city enthusiast, it should be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is not much building;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos Ancient City is geographically and administratively within the borders of Koycegiz. However, we also include it in the pages of Ortaca district in terms of its proximity to Dalyan and ease of transportation for tourists. You can reach the ancient city of Kaunos with a ten-minute walk from the ruins pier, which you can reach from Dalyan by boat. Those who come by yacht from the sea can anchor around Delikli Island and go to the pier by boat. Kaunos, which was an important commercial port city in ancient times, lost its port feature over time as the sea was filled with alluvium. According to Herodotus, the father of history, the people of Kaunos were among the native people of Caria, but they considered themselves Cretans. The geographer Strabo also writes that Kaunos has a shipyard and a port that can be closed. The city was founded by Kaunos, the son of Miletos, who was exiled from the city for having an inappropriate relationship with his twin sister. The rock tombs, which can also be seen from Dalyan, were built in the 4th century BC and later used in the Roman Period.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is the historical ancient city of Dalyan. The region welcomes millions of tourists every year, the Ministry of Culture should show enough attention..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The view is priceless. However, you have to climb quite high to see that view, so you'd better choose comfortable shoes because it's not easy to climb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city is beautiful. It is more enjoyable to walk around knowing the history of the city. You have to go up the hill to the south of the city and watch the view of Dalyan. If you climb up the hill behind the ancient theater, you will get out more easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
am kaunos heart today in extremely beautiful places. As an ancient city lover, I enjoyed traveling very much. We only went when we got out of marmaris with our vehicle, as we did not know that the boats could cross from the center of the dahlia. Fortunately, there was a ferry with a car, but we passed on the other side of the dahlia with our vehicle. Otherwise, it would be an ordeal to go back the same way again. You be the one to cross with mini boats from the sea. Do you want to go to the top of Kaunos? It's definitely a sight to fall in love with. I was amazed. But we mixed up the walking route while we were going. We unknowingly took off on steeper (actually, no walking paths) roads. I had a few fall hazards, after coming out a bit, when I looked down, I was dizzy, I didn't want to continue any further. But my wife motivated me and we continued. Have good shoes on your feet. After continuing for a while, we came across a group of friends, they knew the way, we continued with them and went down with them. Turns out the road wasn't that hard, we made it difficult;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The men did not build a bridge just to increase boat tourism. There is a ferry to the other side, 15 TL on the way back, but you can go with it and go to the stone tombs and the ancient city. We paid 80 TL, he only took us to a pier, 1 km away from the ancient city. We toured the city in 1 and a half hours, and the captain waited for us. Afterwards, a kiyidi near the stone graves stopped for a little while. He gave a little tour to see if there was a caretta caretta, then he took a tour of Dalyan's Bosphorus, oh then we gave 100 TL.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It can be more well maintained. It has an entrance with a museum card. I like the old Lima side. There are many bees;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An amazing history, Anatolian civilization and homeland of cultures. If Kaunos were more well-kept, if a protective roof was built over mosaics, if we had a lot of young people who graduated from archaology, if they were hired and raised them up, the expenses would be covered by those who visited. Years of history are about to disappear. Sincerely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city is beautiful, but the museums administration did not care a bit. All he does is put it at the box office and cut money. There are no signposts, no pathways, nothing inside. We visited a lot of places this summer, this was the strangest place. We opened google maps and looked at the satellite image to see how we can get to the top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A must see place. After crossing the boat, walk for 15 minutes on the stony road. If you say I'm tired. They bring it with Traktor. There is an entrance fee, but the museum card is valid. While visiting the city, goats come out from everywhere. Attention to cute animals 😀 @melekileserhatyolda;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is a walking distance of about 2 km from Dalyan by boat. If it is not hot, it is a very fun track. It has a magnificent view. The ruins are beautiful, but I'd love Karacasu Aphrodisias alone😊;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
History to be seen in Dalyan town.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The weather is very nice and the humidity is low. The boats are 25 tl per person to go to the beach. For the river type, you need to rent a special one, between 450 and 600 TL. The hostels and environment here are very nice, I recommend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The entrance to the King's tombs has been closed for 4 years, people are jumping past the fences, then why do you add it as a touristic place. Mugla municipality is trying to develop the people's region, I think they are trying to develop their region. The roads are already terrible dust soil everywhere, I'm glad I passed it, a pancake was invented, there is no grocery store. There are no small tradesmen called. It's like a district of deprivation. I'm sorry, we are very rich, I think you fill your stomach by eating honey. Ferry departure with car is 40 TL, brother, we came with a bidet, at least, if we saw that much, it's a shame what did you do in MUĞLA MUNICIPALITY all season.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you go to Dalyan and stay between iztuzu beach and Kaunos, go to the beach. It is an ancient city where there is nothing much except a couple of views. I hope it gets more attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
have not seen a complete redirect without maintenance. The toilet was not good. There is a small coffee house inside. The entrance is 14 TL. You should visit with a guide or read the history thoroughly beforehand. Otherwise it doesn't make much sense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a must-see place, it's very hot, don't go, I say enjoy it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Wireless Access to the Site: **(2)\ With your car, you can take the simple ferry of the Dalyan Boat Cooperative from the sea to the opposite shore for 23 TL.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a perfect place, but you should spare 2 or 3 hours of comfortable time to visit, there are wonderful places to photograph, you can take the ferry from Dalyan by car, or you can reach it by boats departing from Dalyan, have a good trip;none;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Few people know, but land transportation is available. The excavation is unfinished.. the walls of the city walls are piled up inside the church, all the stones that are seen in pilgrimage.. the sandboxes are in the middle.. there are no explanatory signs. We could see the site plan of the city somewhere.. the authorities are very interested, but they try to help as much as they can. The entrance is 10 TL per person.. We remember the road is more beautiful than the city.. You pass through the greenery between the mountains and 2 mountains. There is a grandfather and grandmother who opened an ethnography museum on the way. .. a very beautiful village..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The place where foreigners come to see it from the other side of the world, but even 99% of the locals don't know,;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It would be better if it was visited after 17.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
must see beauty;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is an ancient civilization with Cretan origins. You can reach Dalyan by ferry. You can go by ferry over Maraş Street by renting a bicycle, motorbike, etc. Museum card is valid at the entrance. You can also enter by paying a small fee and buying a ticket. Make sure to go out to the ancient harbor and the castle. Follow the red-painted stones for the castle path. The scenery is breathtaking. Believe it will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Nothing, rubble rubble, stony;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Since the ancient city of Kaunos consists of a peninsula, transportation to the ancient city is by boat or ferry. By paying 5 TL per person, you cross the ferry and reach the entrance of the ancient city by walking about 500 m. The ancient city is located in a natural wonder and each structure is interesting in its own way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The theater is under renovation. It's a little difficult to walk around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is spread over a wide area. You can see the preserved historical ruins, the Ancient Theatre, the Roman Bath and the church, the settlements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city of Kaunos, Hellenistic architectural structures are uniquely enjoyable. But mother nature has built such a throne that the olive tree that springs from the stone steps of the amphitheater is as magnificent as the theater.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
history nature An unspoiled city. The excavation is completed, and when the restoration is finished, we will have a wonderful ancient city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's really hard to learn the way to go without reading the comments here. Our belly broke until we learned to cross the street by boat for 5 TL from Dalyan. If you don't want to drink coffee in a cool place with very reasonable prices when you cross the street and then walk to the ancient city, you can go by tractor. You can also buy water and drinks from here, because the prices in the museum are definitely more expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you like to visit ancient cities, it is a must-see place. If you enter through the open iron door that you first see, the entrance is a little difficult, you will not have to walk much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is one of the ancient cities where the structures spread over a wide area can be seen most clearly, it would be nice if a few more signboards with a beautiful road were added and because it is zero to the lake, one should be prepared for mosquitoes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos, which was a commercially important port city in Antiquity, lost its port feature over time as the sea was filled with alluvium. According to Herodotus, the father of history, the people of Kaunos were from the native people of Caria, but they considered themselves Cretans. The geographer Strabo also writes that Kaunos has a shipyard and a port that can be closed. The city was founded by Kaunos, the son of Miletos, who was exiled for having an inappropriate relationship with his twin sister. The rock tombs, which can also be seen from Dalyan, were built in the 4th century BC and later used in the Roman Period. There are three stone beds on which the dead were laid in the Lycian type tombs. There are two Ionic columns on the façade, a frieze and pediment on the columns. There are lion reliefs on one of the pediments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It has become a ruin, there is neither a city nor a historical building. There are only stones, structures are ruined, history is ruined. Just like the ancient theater standing. The history needs to be preserved, maintained and rebuilt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Take water with you;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The most neglected ancient city I have ever seen, there is no explanatory information or signage bigger than itself, as if it was abandoned to its fate, there is not even a road, there is no parking lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very beautiful historical ancient city, I recommend you to see it once, if you have a museum card, you can enter with it, otherwise it is paid per person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a port city, but over time, alluviums lost its connection with the sea, I visited a beautiful place, but very few of them were unearthed, but in the hands of foreigners, they all came to light.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Every part of the Aegean is an ancient city and I don't think this place is in the top ten. It's also hard to go. It must be an art historian or an archaeologist or something just going to see this place..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
went with the canal boat with the canal tour. Definitely a must see place. Dalyan lake view, where you can take pictures as much as its history, is also very beautiful. Even though there is a buffet, I recommend bringing water with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city of Kaunos, with its history going back to the 6th century BC, is the old port city of Dalyan, which I believe will increase in popularity day by day. Kaunos was such a big city for that period what Istanbul is today. However, due to the alluviums of the Dalyan Stream filling the port and the sea being moved 5 km further, it lost its importance in time. If you can climb two hills when you come here, a wonderful view will accompany you. Don't forget to drink the wonderful pomegranate juice of the sweet-spoken sister at the Iniste harbor part... even if it doesn't require tiring professional equipment and knowledge, keep your attention. goat paths will show you the way. Don't go out in the heat of the day, you'll have a hard time;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you have come to Sultaniye hot springs, then do not neglect to stop by here, I recommend you to see the museum, which works from 18.00 in summer to 17.00 in winter, there is a road by car, just ask everyone, the museum card is valid, it is free for under 18 years old (muse card). You can buy the prices I took pictures).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Entrance fee. There are no proper direction signs around. You don't know which way to go. So so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a big city. You can reach the Dalyan Kaunos tea garden with a half-hour walk by crossing the boats operated by the women sitting on the left trf. Ancient cities are places where it is more possible to visualize and get excited if you get information about them before visiting. I think that if you get information about this place in advance, it will be a pleasure to visit. Explains kdr to 7. Ayhan brother, the officer at the box office, is very knowledgeable about the city and complains a lot about the fact that the visitors don't wonder at all. Make Ayhan brother talk, he will tell it with love.😊;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Unfortunately, the ancient city is falling into disrepair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ancient City of Kaunos, Capital of Carians;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
don't know if it's because of the renovation. There are warnings of renovations around, but I haven't seen any repairs. Too messy. Goats roam in it. There are villagers who collect crops from olive trees. Information signs are insufficient. The place where the king tombs are located is about 1 km away and is closed. It is one of the ancient cities that must be visited. An ancient city inhabited by 2 civilizations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ancient City of Kaunos Kaunos, which was a commercially important port city in ancient times, lost its port feature over time as the sea was filled with alluvium. According to Herodotus, the father of history, the people of Kaunos were from the indigenous people of Caria, but they considered themselves Cretans. The geographer Strabo also writes that Kaunos has a shipyard and a port that can be closed. The city was founded by Kaunos, the son of Miletos, who was exiled for having an inappropriate relationship with his twin sister. The rock tombs, which can also be seen from Dalyan, were built in the 4th century BC and later used in the Roman Period. There are three stone beds on which the dead were laid in the Lycian type tombs. There are two Ionic columns on the façade, a frieze and pediment on the columns. There are lion reliefs on one of the pediments. The port of the city was Sülüklü Lake below the acropolis. At that time, the sea was coming up to the acropolis of Kaunos. After the Persians completely captured Anatolia, the city came under the rule of Mausolos. After Alexander defeated the Persians in 334 BC, it came under the rule of Princess Ada, then Antigonos, and then Ptolemy. The Kingdom of Rhodes remained under the sovereignty of the Pergamon Kingdom and the Roman Empire. It started to lose its importance with the filling of the port. The Acropolis was built on a hill of 152 meters high. The one on the north side of the walls is from the Middle Ages. The long wall starts from the north side of the harbor and extends to the steep cliff beyond the Dalyan Village. The northern part of the wall was built during the Mausolos period. Those to the northwest are from the Hellenistic Period. The ones towards the harbor are from the Archaic Period. The theater is at the foot of the acropolis. There are 33 rows of seats. One of the building remains to the west of the theater belongs to a basilica type church. The others belong to the Roman Bath and Temple. Behind the structure, which is built in the form of an incomplete circle and has smooth columns, there is a podium raised with three steps. Here you can see the ruins of the temple. It is not known what the circular structure was. The stoa was unearthed during the excavations carried out in the north of Sülüklü Göl, the old port. Many statue bases were found around it, but no statues were found. The fountain near the stoa has been restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
As someone who values the traces of the past, it was a place I enjoyed visiting. It was a great moment for us that we will never forget, performing amateur theater plays with my children, spending good times with my wife and dancing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A history built on the rocks;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
How beautiful was an ancient city. The fact that it is spread over a large area and that the remaining structures form a complete city is wonderful, not to mention the nature landscape it is in. It can be reached by walking through the village in 15 minutes, don't use it, you won't regret it, don't forget to buy the freshly squeezed narsu in front of the villagers' houses, it's delicious;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There are many must-see structures in Kaunos, which was an important port city in ancient times. They put a small ferry for 2 cars. You can arrive after a very short journey. It is also possible to use without a vehicle. Access by road is very difficult and troublesome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An ancient city that is so different that it may rarely be seen in the world.. an amazing nature and an exquisite geography... Travel by land vehicle, both by land and by sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It smells like history, but it is not correct to charge 17.5 TL at the entrance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
On the day we went, it was occupied by vandal television broadcasters who had permission to shoot the documentary. Control is zero.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Do not leave without seeing this wide historical area, which still contains the important building blocks of the period in terms of architecture and has a unique view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It takes about 1 hour from Köyceğiz. The asphalt is not bad, but the road is bumpy and winding. Especially the theater, terrace building and round structure have preserved their integrity. You can stop by Sultaniye hot springs on the road and take a mud bath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Definitely go and visit if you came to Dalyan..An ancient city built on a very beautiful place. There are still buildings left. You will enjoy visiting.. The best activity is to pluck the branches and serve the wild goats friendly.. There are goats everywhere..They also love pretzels. you can stop the boats from the pier whenever you want ;)";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You have to cross the boat from Dalyan and walk 1.5km, the entrance fee is 10tl, free for under 18 years old, cows and goats are spread inside, in my opinion, tilos was more beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a very fascinating place. Those who come to visit this place should increase at least half a day. There are many places to see to be examined. But unfortunately I do not know enough about the excavations, because there are no restored places. The restoration was not very amateurish, either.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
must see paradise. Don't forget to take mosquito repellent with you and, if possible, a nice camera. If you have a car, use it to go to Iztuzu beach because it is perfect to walk on the 7 km long sandy beach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It hosts rare and wonderful works that must be visited and seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very beautiful nature, historical beauties, the sea is perfect;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Museum card valid. Excavation works continue. The ruins are really beautiful. Access is easy. If it's close to your way, be sure to see it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Quietly listening...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's an impressive city. Don't go by car, you'll get around, ferries are 20 TL. Only if you are not an expert on the subject in this ancient city, if you do not have a little curiosity, there is no direction etc.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
region surrounded by natural beauty. It is home to many bird, reptile and plant species. If you want, you can climb the castle on foot and watch the whole of Dalyan, Iztuzu beach and Dalyan strait from the top.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can feel like you are in another world. It should definitely be visited... Far from the settlement of God. If it was close, the construction around it would not have been passed. It is an ancient city that has been preserved in this way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A neglected, neglected ancient city. It is an archeological value trace, where the people around the city benefited from the existence of the city by selling goods and services at exorbitant prices, but they did not show any interest and support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
was here in 1991. We rented a place opposite the king tombs and pitched a tent. It is a bit difficult now. Kaunos, which was a commercially important port city in Antiquity, lost its port feature over time as the sea was filled with alluvium. The rock tombs, which can also be seen from Dalyan, were built in the 4th century BC and were later used in the Roman Period.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It all started with seeing the Kaunos sign and deviating.. It was an adventure to cross the roads that even off roaders can't get enough of, with a 5 cm high fabia from six places.. A scenic view of the place, its natural history is magnificent, but there is no right straight way to go ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Unfortunately, it is not well known. An ancient city with a beautiful landscape. Since it is an old port city, it is known that they used a customs house and customs laws in order to carry out the trade life in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Culture and human history... Cradle of civilizations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Do people get excited in a historical settlement? Must See. Of course, you will not see an advertisement for the organization or Turkish Tourism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Super. Definitely visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is very difficult to reach, but I had only seen the king tombs from Dalyan on a boat tour before. A hidden value that must be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A very nice place. But the road is very winding and bumpy. The road is a little challenging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's not nice to go with a child who doesn't like to walk or in a stroller. It is extremely hot in the summer, and the most beautiful autumn and spring are also visited.. worth seeing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Traihi place is nice, but I don't prefer land transportation, boat tours are better....;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
After the unique nature of Dalyan, a trip to the ancient city of Kaunos is invaluable. You reach Kaunos by boat from Dalyan to the opposite shore, the ruins that must be visited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
They are not well informed, there is no sign, there is no well-organized and systematic road map, you travel randomly, it gets harder in the heat. It happens when you question whether I came all this way for a mess. Still history, our respect is endless, the entrance fee was 14 TL per person, the children were not paid. Other entrances are also I think there was no box office there;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is set in a beautiful place with a beautiful view, but there is not much to see inside. If the excavations are over in Sagalassos, I recommend you to choose there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It would be true if I say that history will permeate all of you. There are places on top of the mountain, the goal is under it, it would be a great place to come to Dalyan, a wonderful place with the harbor probably settled by the sea in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
fasten your sneakers tight;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The view is magnificent: iztuzu beach (Karetta karatta beach, Muğla Dalyan delta, the sea looks wonderful, when you turn your head to the other side, Kaunos King tombs, the twisting Dalyan River, orange and lemon groves. You can take your food and drink and spend a whole day here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is recommended that we ate sweetgum pancakes near a beautiful ancient city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos.An impressive ancient city overlooking the magnificent Dalyan beach. The crossing point of the Lycian and Carian civilizations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
With boat tours, you can start from Köyceğiz and go to Dalyan and from there to Iztuzu Beach via canals. The king tombs, located on the other side of the canal just across the Dalyan settlement, are unique and worth seeing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A very well preserved huge city;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It has an amazing view and history. While visiting the city, I realized that there are historical buildings that need more attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a must see place, but very neglected. You should sit in the amphitheater and watch the surroundings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There are boater sisters by the tea garden, go to the opposite shore by boat 5TL(2018). If you pass by bicycle, which I think, they buy for bicycle for 5 TL. Walking in the heat is very bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Impressive works; the theater and the fountain system in front of it. Excavations still continue.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Considering the conditions of the time, the ancient cities and tombs that are still admirable how they were built and have been preserved until today... A unique work like the King Rock Tombs in Amasya and the ancient city of Pedra in Jordan, I wonder if the natural structure was still the same before it was built leaving questions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A wonderful and magnificent place. You can go by boat or on foot. You can also go by car if you wish. Be sure to add it to your visit plans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the beautiful ancient cities in our country, you can stop by here and tour for 12 hours while taking a boat tour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos, which was a commercially important port city in Antiquity, lost its port feature over time as the sea was filled with alluvium. According to Herodotus, the people of Caunos were from the indigenous people of Caria, but they considered themselves Cretans. Geographer Strabo also said that Kaunos had a shipyard and a sealable port / Kaunos, which was a commercial port city in antiquity, lost its character as a port when the sea was filled with alluvium. According to Herodotus, the Caunos were among the inhabitants of Caria, but they considered themselves Cretans. Geographer Strabon also said that Caunos had a shipyard and a harbor that could be closed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Although a beautiful Theater remains from the ancient city, other excavations are presented with a lack of information, I wish detailed information was given next to each building.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There are many works that need to come to light. A suitable place for trekking. Don't go in a hurry without water with you. It's hot, it doesn't hurt;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is no sign, the track inside is not marked and not followed. Brochure etc. like sketch. It's like it was built so that it wouldn't be visited without a guide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Our ancient city is famous for its place of establishment, the beauty of its scenery and, of course, being too neglected like our other ancient cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It should definitely be visited, you need to take time to see its splendor, the view is magnificent with everything.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is one of the historical places of my country, but unfortunately our people are still unconscious, and donkeys in the middle and dung on the ground, even if we do not show a little respect for history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is not much to see except the ancient theater and king tombs, but if you are a history lover, you can go if it is close to your way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Travel and travel, you are getting lost in a never ending history, this must be a beautiful trip in history;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
think it is one of the most beautiful ancient cities in the world. Visit this ancient city with a magnificent view of Danyan with a boat tour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's pretty irrelevant here. There are those who go up to the castle on the hill, but there is no way. It is not even clear whether dating is dangerous or forbidden. There is no information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's one of the places to see, it's a very nice place, I recommend it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The second most beautiful ancient city I have ever seen ✔;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Let's read the history of the city in a brochure while walking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is an incredibly beautiful place that everyone should see. The scenery is fascinating. It is necessary to come in the morning and leave time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Nice atmosphere, do good research before you arrive alone, the roads are mixed, we were victims;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The landscape is wonderful..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The royal tombs from Dalyan are very easy to reach, it is forbidden to look closely for now, water is not sold inside on Monday, I guess it was a bit of a problem, but other than that, it's a great place;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is one of the origin cities of the historical Caunos civilization. An ancient city that must be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the ancient structures to visit for those who love history, a beautiful architectural work built on the Dalyan lagoon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I've never seen such a disgrace, there is no respect for history, people go all that way, they get an entrance fee for nothing, there is no guide to tell, nor a simulator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A very beautiful ancient city. More excavation work needs to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Those who regret going because the road is far, what can I tell you, I went and didn't want to leave there, it's a magnificent campus, it's definitely a must go, the road is tough but worth it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It would be better if there was care and promotion. Our country is at the forefront of history. Most countries that dominate the world left a mark in Turkey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
While we were visiting the city, we did not understand where we were and what structure we were looking at. Apart from that, the city is geographically positioned in a perfect place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
very nice place to visit, a must visit if you come to dalyan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a bit of a bad road, but the entrance fee for a place that can be visited is 14 TL.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Let's drink, get better and save the country, the magnificent city of Kaunos, the man of the time. There is also a ferry that you can cross the river with your car. I think you should not die without seeing it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It would be great if it was easier to access.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It can be worked on, can be developed, a wonderful work, the sunset is worth seeing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A huge and impressive ancient city. But whoever is head of restoration should know that he is only renovating with new shiny marble. Too bad. He's officially killing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's okay, it's paid, the way is neglected, it's still the same;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is no service provided other than the entrance fee. There are no information or direction signs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An ancient city with a perfect texture, view and road is recommended (don't go in the heat);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city is very beautiful, and if you do not have a health problem, you must go to the top of the kaunos, the view is wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Definitely take your time lazing around on the beach here. Mud bath or something, let's visit here and here and develop our culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A must visit place. Very nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I recommend everyone to visit izkumu rock tombs and ancient city with these beautiful boat trips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
.very beautiful ancient city, well-kept, immaculate. Green. we loved it;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Suuklu lake looks great from the ancient theater. If you can climb up to the castle, you can encounter an incredible view of Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I would recommend those who have the opportunity to visit a beautiful ancient city, if you like history, it can be a good choice for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The view is beautiful. They built the castle in a very strategic place, but when it became fertile, the place constantly changed hands. You are walking a little uphill. But it's worth..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
To reach the ancient cities that embraced the ancient tribes who lived in this beautiful COUNTRY like us...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the must see historical places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ours has been restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a very beautiful ancient city that has been neglected a bit, but definitely worth a visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is difficult with children, but Meriç cafe, which is the place to eat pancakes and rest at the boat stop, is wonderful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The place where you make the toilet….;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Not worth visiting. The entrance fee is 10 TL if you do not have a museum card.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you have come to Dalyan, do not return without seeing it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient city, located on the magnificent Dalyan lagoon system, must be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A wonderful ancient city is very impressive, there is a large area of settlement, it should definitely be visited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The location is very nice..Baskent University has done successful archaeological studies here..it was very pleasant to sit in the theater..walk on its roads..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Local and national excavation;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Make sure to bring water with you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's beautiful, I recommend everyone to go;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the must-see places among the ancient cities of Caria, it is more suitable for visiting preferably in the spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
one of the must visit places;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I can't describe the scenery. The establishment on the hill caught my attention. Men were fond of taste even back then;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's an awesome place. It should definitely be visited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We went during the holidays. The buffet was closed. There was no place to get water nearby. WC was very dirty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the places to visit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The historical cemeteries carved into the BC mountain are wonderful. Dalyan is beautiful. Nature, tranquility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's unclear where the entrance is...No sign of what is where...so it's like the year...2020 BC.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An excellent historical place, definitely a must-see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Definitely a must see. Don't forget to go to the top and watch Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's great, but my advice is to take plenty of water with you and spare at least 2 hours. Of course, I also recommend you to go cream against the scorching heat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
By paying 20 TL, you can cross the ferry with your car and walk 100 meters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Port city. It is 20 minutes from Dalyan by boat and walking from there. Or you can reach it with minibus tractors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The going is very difficult. If you go from Köyceğiz, you can go directly, but it is necessary to travel with boats from dalyan. Go and see the royal tombs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You will feel the craftsmanship that people carved their traces on stones thousands of years ago in the ancient civilization ruins, you will be curious about them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Do not go at noon, your brain will burn. The buffet is closed, make sure to take water and go, but go. The sea is not always sand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a place that needs to be worked very hard, there is neither a man telling history nor anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is an amazing city worth seeing for those who really love history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient theater is incredibly well preserved. be sure to see it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is imperative that there are tables or booklets that guide more regularly and tell the history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Free people over 65 are very helpful;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Goats accompany you on the trip, olive trees and history meet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I recommend you to visit the history and nature, which is worth seeing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The historical place road is a little bit inside, you can go to see it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is a very beautiful ancient city that must be visited.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Where kings live with elite venues. Prices are reasonable;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very interesting for history lovers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the most beautiful historical places to visit in Turkey;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A big ancient city, muzekart is valid, its amphitheater is beautiful;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you are on your way, it is one of the must-see places..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A paradise lost in history that was a settlement in the first age;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It would be nice if the witness of the past has a solution that is difficult to reach some points, he wants to see those areas as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is one of the places that should be missed by those who love to visit historical places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Places worth seeing, but take your water with you 500 ml of water 5 TL ice cream 12 TL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A must visit. We took our breath away when we saw the theater.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You are amazed by the human power, it is so beautiful, I am amazed, personally, only the cities made of stone should definitely visit ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A beautiful ancient city, very beautiful and must visit for the curious;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
In fact, there are beautiful historical artifacts if they are not left to the goats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
For Cybele's sake, there are beautiful frogs here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We did not have the opportunity to visit. But I think it is worth visiting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Considering that it was built at that time, it is wonderful, especially the king rock cemeteries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos, one of the ancient cities in Köyceğiz, is one of the places worth visiting with its decor and architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Missing direction signs, well kept, worth a visit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Definitely a must see place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ascent was very difficult even by car. Even after entering the ancient city, transportation is problematic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
He should definitely be made like a man. A huge ancient city, but there is no order inside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's nice, it's very warm, I think you should travel in winter. Prolonged trouble in August.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a must see place with a very old history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

a must see place;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The city is very beautiful, but restoration is a must, I hope it will be restored as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is no work for years left to its fate;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You must see the ancient city. Maybe you can meet the squirrel family;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
worth a visit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is still inconceivable how people put those big stones in that era.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A person should realize why he couldn't fit into the world when he was able to fit in his mother's womb, and eventually he would have to fit in one square meter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's gorgeous, it's more beautiful than I expected. I couldn't visit every part of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Make sure to climb the hill where the ancient city is located and watch the view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the must see places;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A very nice town, except for the municipality trying to extract oil from the fly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is possible to see different-purpose structures built at different times, spread over a wide area, together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Fill your coffee in the thermos and be there at 5 o'clock The sunset is legendary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You will need water, they sell small water for 4 TL there, advise me, get your water before you go there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Wonderful. It would be even more wonderful if we could visit, but the door was locked. As far as I understand it will be privately operated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A VERY ADVANCED PORT CITY OF ITS TIME, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CARIA CIVILIZATIONS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The walking distance is long, but when you reach the ancient city, you will see that it is worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
take a walk in the morning or evening hours and you will see the layers of history;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Not enough careful study has been done;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We couldn't go, we didn't know how to get there, the path is not clear, we became the border;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful must-see places;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can't go up to the acropolis, other than that it's a nice place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An officer there said that this place was only excavated during the summer months and by volunteer students. It's very painful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Restoration continues;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is a church, bath and castle, its area is very large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The view of Dalyan from the ancient city is wonderful. So are the rock tombs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's very nice to go and see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Definitely a place to visit when you go to dalyan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It reminds a little sumela, the road is very winding and you stay on the hill;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Magnificent Landscape A place that must be visited..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Going by road is death, plus bad if you're in the sun. Worth the view;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Informational text is too little. No brochures. Insufficient promotion;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is really full of history, but it needs to be explored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A view that will prolong one's life, especially at night;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Entry fee is very high;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I think it's great history and nature;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I advise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It's worth going and seeing, but it's a bit messy inside;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It can be designed and developed much more;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's not a big deal, it may not be drawn in the heat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It would be better if it was restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
charming place;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It looks very neglected to me..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Every corner of my country has been popular for centuries;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

I recommend you to visit it via Dalyan, it is possible to go to the ancient city with boats, it is fun, the fee is 20 TL per person, then you arrive with a 15-minute walk. If you have a museum card, you can visit it for free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can choose the more adventurous route by car between the mountains, or you can take the ferry from Dalyan which takes a few minutes. It's ok for a short trip, but it didn't bother me that much. Cracked stool. There is no toilet on site. You can buy drinks there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Fascinating ancient site with 2,5 thousand-year-old tombs carved into the rocks. Then there are the ruins, especially the amphitheater with stunning views of the Mediterranean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Excellent archaeological site. Lots to see and in great condition. You can buy a boat from the dock and 40 liras for 2 people. (Just pay to pass there, it's free on the way back, but leave a tip for the ladies) the walk itself is not a difficult hike, it's bumpy, it's best to walk as it's cooler in the morning. the site itself is of course open air so it gets super hot there. You can walk to the Castle on top of the mountain but that's not for the faint of heart. The amphitheater is gorgeous and the views from the top of it are unmatched.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very good experience. It was very convenient to have a ferry that took us from Dalyan to Kaunos. Kaunos is kept clean, well-kept and fun to explore.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
not fez but still an interesting place. The amphitheater is being partially restored and a rather faded tessera floor was uncovered under the Byzantine church. The signage is pretty weak and a simple map can be very helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"For antique lovers We went to it by boat as part of a tourist group. One road leads directly from the parking lot to the ruins. From a historical point of view, the place is interesting, the impressions in general are unbiased. You can go once, but not anymore. At the entrance, in principle, there is a regular safe, and if the memory is working, they even accept cards, but I stock up on cash just in case. Toilet \dot\ "" is of type";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The site can be reached on foot from Dalyan, it is enough to cross the river with the boats right in front of the restaurant. 20 TL round trip from the municipality (municipality) After reaching the other bank, it is enough to walk 1 km to the kaunos site Le site est accessible à pied depuis dalyan, il suffit de traverser la rivière par les barques a rames qui se trouvent juste en face du restode la municipalité ( municipality) 20 tl aller retour , une fois arrivée à l'autre rive, il suffit de marcher pendant 1 km jusqu'à site de kaunos;в составе туристической группы. Сразу от места стоянки к развалинам ведет тропа. С исторической точки зрения место интересное;в целом впечатления нейтральные.Один раз можно съездить;но не более того.На входе в принципе нормальная касса;и если не изменяет память;то там даже принимают карты;"но я бы на всякий случай запасся наличкой.Туалет типа \""очко\""";так что если туда и ходить то скорее по-маленькому.Отличные впечатление произвел амфитеатр;"он действительно масштабный и более-менее хорошо сохранился.""";https://www.google.com.tr/none;none;;;;;;
It is a wonderful place, the history of this place is great, its stones are still standing like other ruins. It can get very hot as the place is very open so I recommend lots of water and a hat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A nice walk down the river. Ongoing excavation is revealing more of this fascinating place. Watch out for the turtles too. Great views from here;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A small walking adventure with a historical background, the main thing is to swim across the river to this place, and you can do it without the tourist emotionless with a local ferry.. From the center of Dalyan, on a low flight, walk about 40 minutes to ancient Kaunos .. walk my brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very interesting historical site. I'm surprised more people haven't visited. Some areas are over 2,000 years old.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Wonderful ruins, must visit! Even though it was raining I still loved the place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great date. 5 thousand years ago!! I can't believe how they built a place like this. More excavation and reconstruction is needed. Across the river from Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ruins of the ancient city of Kaunos. You can enter the harbor by boat. It is thought to have been founded between 1500 and 2000. It was damaged by earthquakes and Arab raids and fell into disrepair. There is an ancient amphitheater, the Acropolis, the temple of Apollo, an ancient mosaic. It can be very hot in the summer. There is no shadow. The entrance fee is not expensive though.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Visited late August 2021. Took the ferry (by car - 23TL each way) from the Dalyan ferry and then drove 1.5km to the site. You can also go by car (90 minutes) or on foot. Not a lot of parking but enough. Wear sneakers. Small shop inside if you want to buy drinks/snacks. Enough shade if hot. Allow approximately 90 minutes to explore. A few information boards also in English. Great photo opportunities. You get a real sense of antiquity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We did a boat tour and we were in Kaunos. The ruins were very impressive. However, we only had one hour, which was very short. You will definitely need 3-4 hours. Drinks can be purchased at the entrance, which is highly recommended especially in summer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very nice! You need to climb the mountain, then you have a great view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
am visiting Dalyan for the second time and this GREEK city is very interesting. If you come to Dalyan, you can't miss a two or three hour getaway. I came with my dog, we had dinner on the way (many women sell juice) and they make pancakes. It's a regional thing. It's sad to see that there isn't enough archeological rescue for these cities by the country. Otherwise I would visit again. I recommend getting there really early because the summer sun is awful and bring water in your backpack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It will be great to enter the seaside with the boats passing through the canal. After the Kayaköy visit, I am sure that they are their ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Well worth a visit if you're looking for something other than the beach. Small entrance fee. Toilets and a small drinks bar. The ruins are well preserved and give a good idea of the site itself, with a few information boards next to the main buildings/structures for history buffs. Suggest to take a walk to the top of a small hill with wonderful views of the delta and ruins, as well as what looks like the ruins of a small Roman guardhouse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Entry 25 Turkish Lira. Nice trip. The amphitheater is being rebuilt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful ruins, but there are better ones in Turkey;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
great find and sometimes so quiet that you can find yourself alone in the amphitheater, which is a humbling experience. Watch out for wild animals roaming like goats, donkeys and turtles. If you are coming from Dalyan, be sure to hop on the small boats to cross the river. Before a 20-minute walk, examine the tombs closely, drink plenty of water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
This is an ancient Roman city with a large number of buildings. It also has a round theater with lots of seating inside. The theater is large but empty. Honestly, it's great there. But there is 1 problem: I had to go to the toilet, but I couldn't find it directly because there were trees blocking the view of the WC sign. But the rest of the city was fine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
love it there, glad I booked the trip, I saw so much history and wildlife worth seeing. Lunch was very delicious cooked by what you ordered and the guide burhran was very helpful, kind and respectful. You will not be disappointed, especially on the boat trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Heavy heavy rains came from this area a few days before us, and gave a life-giving amount of H2O to the plant life and these remains. Super cool amphitheater with trees growing from seats. Beautiful Roman arches jutting out of the parliament building. They also had a really cool round catwalk used to keep track of the days of the year in the lunar calendar. Great little spot to wander around and explore in the afternoon ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Really great place. As it is also an archaeological education centre, many things can only be seen from afar, which makes it very untouched. Definitely recommended especially during the boat tour!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Many things were closed, people seemed to be skipping the signs and climbing everything anyway. Access to the rock tombs is closed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
For what it's worth, it's a place where all visual cultures intersect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is so much to see. We should have arranged for longer than an hour but we will be back to do it justice. There were a few areas that were inaccessible due to the restructuring, but that had little effect on our appreciation of what was before us. We were lucky enough to get there early so the crowds were minimal, but I hope the crowd can be tolerated even during peak hours. A hidden gem that benefits from minimal publicity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Expression of ancient beauty, cheap boat (7.5tl return) and entrance (14tl). Coming here in the early morning of March, when the weather is not hot and the tourists are still sleeping, is very appealing. Be prepared to walk, it will take 20 minutes from the last tea garden to the entrance. The entryway is poorly maintained and makes you more into history. Spend at least 2 hours admiring the lagoon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Dalyan is one of the most memorable and worth seeing places in Turkey, especially if you want to feel the touch of history. For a small entrance fee you can see the beautiful ancient historical site (dating back to the 10th century BC). The dried up area that was once the sea, now the sea is far away and the ancient ruins of the amphitheater and old city that were mighty and mighty a day ago - amazing and monumental#KaunosDalyan#KaunosDalyanTurkey#KaunosTürkiye#TurkeyTourism;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very beautiful view from the top of the mountains and Daylan's Delta. It's worth a visit when you're in the area. The entrance fee is 14TL per person. Children under the age of 8 have free admission. If you have your own car, you can take the ferry from Dalyan. A journey every 15 minutes costs 20 TL per vehicle including passengers, approximately 5 minutes. Ferry max. Fits 3 cars. There was no waiting time with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Worth a visit if you are staying in Dalyan. After boarding the kayak service along the river, it's a 10-15 minute stroll through the rustic countryside, past street vendors selling pomegranate smoothies and jams, before reaching the sloped access road to the grounds. 25tl buys you entry and you are free to roam in all directions. Each area has multiple information boards that let you know what was previously used, such as a church, bathhouse or private building. It is a very pleasant and fascinating place to visit but there is only the cafe area that offers shade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Quite an interesting place with a preserved ancient city from the first half of the 1st century BC. former. AD Amphitheater, baths, temples and many other stone buildings. I would like more information support for exhibitions. But they all look great together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is an ancient city that can be easily reached from both Marmaris and Fethiye. Ancient theater with some other ruins and very beautiful views. There are also Lycian rock tombs just a few kilometers away. I took the ferry to Kaunos, then walked through the orange groves towards the tombs. The entrance was closed but you can see them from the road and the walk was still nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is on the UNESCO tentative list of Turkey and it is easy to understand why. (Although the amphitheater is quite small) and covers a large area and has many well-preserved tourist attractions. The entrance fee was 14 TL. It can also be visited by taking a boat tour from the nearby city of Dalyan. Or you can take the ferry across the river by foot (5tl for pedestrians).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Amazing site with many viewpoints on the delta below and Iztuzu beach. Don't forget the ancient theater with olive trees in the stands. Museum card is possible for entry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The site mainly hosts ruins from the Roman period. There is an old church which is very rare to see. If you happen to be in Dalyan, I think you should visit the ancient city for a little while. It is also located in one of the best tourist spots in the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Intern and nice place. You can reach Dalyan by boat, by passing the spill or by ferry, in a car.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
There is so much to see in Kaunos, the 3 main areas, the temple on the hill, the amphitheater and the fountain. It's hot there, so the walk to the temple or the tractor and caravan is hot. Go early in the morning to miss the midday heat. Now you can reach most areas that are better protected but still offer better views. It dates back to the early Roman period and is still wonderful to walk in the footsteps of the ancients.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Historically interesting place. You may need at least 4 hours to see interesting things in a calm manner. You can see many amphibians such as turtles, but beware of snakes if you walk alone in less visited places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An archaeological place mostly frequented by Europeans, it has a Roman theater and some existing and ruined Roman ruins, the place is about an hour from the highway, the road is full of nature's beauties …;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's an archaeological place mostly frequented by Europeans, it has a Roman theater and some existing and ruined Roman ruins, the place is about an hour from the highway, it's true that the road is full of nature's beauties, but it's tiring because of the many winding roads of the line, there are beautiful lakes and views on the site, but useful for others History and antique lovers;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
What was built back then is impressive. If you follow the red dots and arrows towards the mountain behind the theatre, you will be rewarded with a magnificent view. It is tiring and should be done with only about 1 liter of water per person and good shoes. But it's worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Wonderful ancient city and surrounding landscapes. In my opinion these are the best ruins in the area. Goats and donkeys were a delightful bonus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Worth visiting. From Dalyan, get on the 5 lira rowing boat across the river, turn left and follow the road for 2km. Children under 12 are free. Adult tickets are 10 TL. Plan to spend 1-2 hours here. There is no cafe so take plenty of water. You can walk to the village 1 km after Kaunos and find a cafe there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Worth a few hours of your time. 5 TL charabanc type tractor towed to go there; worth avoiding the long walk up the hill! There are a few dotted explanatory notes in Turkish and English that are helpful. The old auditorium is gorgeous!";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
very nice place! The only sad thing is that you can admire it from the side while on board. No one is allowed to come near. Big turtles were promised to us on this tour. We have seen them from afar. They go up for a second to get some air and dive back in. That's why photographing them is unrealistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A beautiful place to explore. I wanted to climb and you can do well here. Sturdy shoes are highly recommended as there is a lot of rubble. At the top, you have a great 360° view;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We went an hour before the entrance closed at 5pm and had the whole space to ourselves. Wandering around the town and the theater ruins is truly magical. Imagine yourself in the hustle and bustle of the ancient port settlement as you head towards Leech Lake. Have a picnic or go to Dalyan at sunset for a meal by the river.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful historical place to see. On the other side of the river. You can get there by boat trip or cross the river in a small boat run by a local woman and then take a little walk. It's worth going there, I highly recommend it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's basically a unique ancient city perched on an idyllic hill with a wonderful 360-degree view. We took small boats run by local women to cross the river and decided to walk up the hill for about 25 minutes. It's hard to say the least in hot weather. But what we got in the end exceeded our expectations. There aren't many people around. You will need more than 3 hours to see them all. Bring food and drink by yourself as the muze cafe is a complete rip-off, now they sell a small bottle of water for 5 TL (2018), it is priced at 0.5 TL in grocery stores like SOK.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Just extraordinary. Visit early or late afternoon as shade is limited and stock up on water. Explore this active archaeological dig site by reading helpful explanations (in Turkish and English) and go back in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A wonderful view. Definitely worth it.. Gorgeous view of Dalyan and its surroundings. You should bring some time, the space is very large. It's very interesting. It's the best in the morning, it's not that hot... Entrance is 10 TL per person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Awesome, I haven't finished it all yet, but I like that the staff take such good care of the place and keep it clean 24 hours, I just have to realize there are some dangerous snakes inside, I saw one on the wall, it's not moving, it didn't follow me, mostly it won't touch you and safely You will walk around, just be careful when touching walls or sitting on an old stone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Magnificent archaeological park with a theater and very well preserved thermal baths. The easiest transportation is by boat from Dalyan district. Then count the 20-minute walk. The rock tombs can be seen on the opposite shore next to the shops and hotels in Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Definitely one of the most beautiful ancient cities to visit! The place is still largely wild and the main monuments have been or are being restored. Allow a few hours to visit the place, about 2 hours for the main sites, and about 4 to 5 hours without exploring the place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Interesting ruins on a large site. Including the magnificent view of Daylan Delta and Dalyan;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos - ancient ruins in a beautiful setting. Worth a visit when visiting Dalyan especially in such a nice company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
He had a great time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A nice place. I recommend for visiting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
large and relatively well preserved ancient city with beautiful views, it is best to take a small boat from Dalyan (try both ways 7.5 times) and then walk one and a half km until you reach Kaunos. The city itself is huge, so you should take a few hours to see everything (official recommendations are 2-hour tour and 4-hour tour).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the best archaeological sites I have visited. And the way we achieve it is also very interesting. A kayak from Dalyan Turkey along the river, then a 2km walk down a very quiet country road. Local vendors selling cold drinks and lavender products along the way. Kaunos itself was only 20tl to enter (Approximately £1). The entire site is a treasure trove of history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very nice archaeological visit. For hikers, feel free to climb to the height behind the amphitheater. Staying on your left, you will find a path that will take you to the top, and then you will see a magnificent view of Dalyan and its surroundings! Water and sports shoes will be provided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Not much has been preserved, but there is still something to look at. There is a wonderful view from the top. The toll is 17.5 liras.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Small but interesting dig in a great location.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Entry is 17.5TL. wide area;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ancient site is a bit less touristy than we are used to seeing in Turkey, accessible by boat from Dalyan, the site remains wild, we encounter a diversified fauna, to be honest the site is Hierapolis, before Troy or Ephesus Site;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HeritageThis area used to be a very busy Catholic town, full of churches and theatres.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful but unfortunately a bit neglected. One of the oldest remnants of a church stands here and is falling into disrepair. Still, it's definitely worth a trip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Fantastic ruin located on the slope that slides into the lagoon. The theater is particularly beautiful. If you go in the summer, avoid daytime nights as it can be very hot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An interesting place for anyone who loves history and historical artifacts. Local monuments are currently being rebuilt. There is a beautiful view of the surrounding area from here and the best way to get here is to take a ferry across the river from Dalyan, which carries both pedestrians, cyclists and cars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's far from there but the road is beautiful, not crowded, you can walk for about 30 minutes if you try. If you have the strength left, then there is a mountain with ruins nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a great site. Awesome view. Part of the venue was closed for restoration but still visible from the outside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The magnificent view and mystical atmosphere of the ancient city of Kaunos takes you on a journey through time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An amazing place to visit from the 50's from Roman times. The boat trip down the estuary was excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Worth a visit as part of a boat trip that tours various places. The highlight was the wild donkeys coming in to see what the noise was when a group of school kids came in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A great day to explore the ancient site, lots of digging and reclamation going on, huge area to dig... well worth the bike ride and river crossing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It was a bit cold and we couldn't see the turtles but it was very nice I recommend it to everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very nice. It is necessary to take the boat from Dalyan or go around the lake. Either way, the nearby sultaniye has an amazing spa and mud bath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Passing by boat from Dalyan, about 1.2 km on the way to the entrance, 10 liras, wide area, on the way back, drink Granada apple juice or consume Ayran and Pancakes before crossing the street stalls;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A beautiful place, it will be beautiful when the excess is collected and the waters accumulated due to the rains come down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
amazing history and stunning to see in real life. It's something to see while you can. It's also easy to do with most boats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Pleasant surprise!!! All areas are accessible. You don't usually get this with inheritance fields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I visited many ancient cities. The cave is beautiful and interesting! 100% visit. The best way. We passed by ferry from Dalyan by car.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Wow..WowThis place has a lot to see and you won't be disappointed.The amphitheater is amazing. You can only imagine what's going on inside. There's a mix of Greek and Roman influences. From the 6th century BC to AD. It is another hidden gem of Dalyan. I can't say more, just visit this energetic little town and see it here. You can walk or bike or drive there depending on your fitness. Wow..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A very beautiful and huge ancient city. It's too wide Take plenty of water with you. The kiosk is only open occasionally. Very unfriendly staff. Treat tourists really badly. Otherwise, if you want to explore everything, you should not choose midsummer. You can cross from Dalyan with a small car ferry. The cost is about 5 lira per person. Just don't let a boat trip get you talking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very beautiful place, ruin in good condition, breathtaking view for the reckless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's an interesting place with an old theater and carved houses inside the mountain... there's a market outside, a bit too touristy and a bit expensive;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A must see in the area!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Loads of history must visit beautiful little place, great places to eat traditional Turkish breakfast is a must try;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Worth a visit but I don't think these ruins are as well looked after as they could be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the best historical places I've ever seen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great resort town! The museum of the ancient city of Kaunos and many tombs and restaurants nearby;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Take the ferry and have a look, convenient old and beautifully preserved;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful place. Very close to the center of Dalyan, a great place to visit. 10/10;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Incredible ruined city with amazing location;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It was great again!! There was also a lot more exposure 26 years ago and since then. It is very beautifully and attractively made. You feel history. blessed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
This place is absolutely great. Too much history. we will be worth seeing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Nice place, not really a history person but I like to see progress every year;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great place entrance fee 25 TL;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's worth to be seen. Crossing the river by boat or ferry. Seeing a lot of wildlife is a must to get to the bottom level.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I recommend going up to the old castle on the hill. (But it can also be dangerous);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you are in Dalyan, it is a good idea to take the small ferry next to the Asur Hotel and walk half a kilometer to see the tracks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
This place is well worth a visit. We took a boat trip on the river and stopped for lunch on the way back. Great value local boat trips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A very good price to enter if you're interested in history, absolutely great p lace to explore. I strongly recommend;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
My friends gave good feedback about the place. It's an old place and a must visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
quiet beautiful place;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Historical place. You can set aside half an hour to an hour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Spectacular views. Loved visiting ancient ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you're a ruin nerd like me, this is Xanadu! ! ! A huge dig site with ongoing finds and wild donkeys and goats added for fun! Extremely cool site!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Take a boat trip from Dalyan Municipality to Iztuzu beach. It is a columned tomb on the mountain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Must visit. Until the remnants of an ancient civilization that lived on the shores of the bay for centuries left the sea and the bay turned into a river valley. A city with a beautiful location in the hills. It's inaccessible from the sea, the closed bay harbor, the castle walls at the top, a theater facing the sea (how fun it must be to watch the performances of the artists against the backdrop of the sea sunset). Also in the church, the mosaic floor has been preserved, but the frescoes are practically not visible. Goats, sheep, turtles, lizards, yellow beetles (legless lizard) roam the area. Take water with you, wear sneakers - you will not want to rush.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great place for digs;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A true sunset paradise, with cleverly constructed facilities reflecting history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I love this place to walk around the views are amazing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a great place to walk around and a seriously good challenge for those who want to go to the castle on the top of the hill...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Many things are under restoration!;still believe that there is a sunken city under the lake. You can see the traces of the peoples living in Köyceğiz in the ancient city, which you can go by boat from Köyceğiz.;You can touch history with your hands. History of Koycegiz Koycegiz, whose history dates back to 3400 BC;Carians;Scythians;Assyrians;Persians;Romans;It has hosted many nations such as Seljuks and Ottomans. There are still many ruins belonging to these nations on it.;artifacts and traces. Although most of these traces have been unearthed, the number of artifacts waiting to be discovered is not few. The city came under Persian rule in 546. In the first half of the 5th century, it became a member of the Attica-Delos Sea Union under the leadership of Athens. Later on Lycia;Caria;They lived under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Macedonia and the Seleucids. After the Roman and Eastern Roman (Byzantine) domination, it first joined the Menteşeoğulları and then the Ottoman lands. Its old name is Yüksekkum. Sultan II.

According to the legend that has been spoken for many years, the story of the name of the village is as follows: The entire city of Köyceğiz, which was built on the area where the lake was located at an unknown time, was destroyed. under water. Those who saw that only a few houses remained from a big city after the disaster;"\""The whole city has sunk";"Only Köyceğiz remained. They said. The people of the town, whose name is very interesting, still believe that there is a sunken city under the lake.""";https://www.google.com.tr/none;none
Ancient ruins worth seeing once;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great place. It's full of history. You can hear and feel the time. Interesting details emerged. The streets are the same as before. Mosaic in the dome church. The entrance fee is symbolic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Worth seeing ancient Greek temples on Turkish soil;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Interesting place with very nice view from the top. The cut rivers are most likely marshland. There are ruins, you can see, walk and plunge into this atmosphere. But be sure to drive or continue on the road and see the amazing nature.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
From the deck of the boat you can see the ancient tombs carved into the rocks, an interesting place for people interested in the subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very beautiful old place with lots of turtles and orange trees;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very interesting. Bigger than I thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AD 1.-6. It's very interesting to look at what's left of the centuries-old buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Finally an uncrowded excavation site! Great impressions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An interesting and beautiful place. There are almost no people. Remains from different times when wild donkeys, goats and sheep roamed. Getting there wasn't easy, but it's definitely worth it!The entrance was 14 liras, but the payment here is cash only, there is no terminal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very beautiful views and ruins, large area and lots of turtles Highly recommend;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Nice site to wander around for a few hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great history, well worth a visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
When in Turkey, you cannot miss such a unique monument. We also met the locals;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An interesting historical place. Entry is 17.5 lira. The amphitheater is the best preserved in the region. The ruins of the basilica also look interesting. If you go down the river, you have a chance to see turtles and crabs. There are not enough roads to climb the upper part of the city and the acropolis, so you will have to climb the difficult, unmarked terrain. Comfortable shoes are required. In the hot season, you should also drink water. It can be purchased at the entrance for 2 liras per bottle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very beautiful and interesting! I recommend everyone to visit the river tour with an overview of the tombs. Be sure to order the blue crabs - the meat is simply divine. Below you will find a clean sea sandy beach where you can swim in a wonderful way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I would watch it again! It is easy to reach by car. There are 2 parking spaces directly on the hill for good drivers. You should be able to rank well. Not much to see but what's good;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Spectacularly preserved Roman ruins. Very cheap entrance fee. A bit of a walk but well worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Gorgeous, under-visited attraction. It's amazing to think they did these things 2400 years ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is an open-air museum that is difficult to reach, you can get there by boat along the river or by mountain roads like long snakes. You can take a boat from Muğla district, stopping at the ancient city of Kaunos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Get on a boat to get around! Also good for hiking and climbing;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ruins of an ancient city at the mouth of the river. The buildings are approximately the same as in other ancient cities of the Roman Empire. Amphitheater, temple, etc. The amphitheater offers a beautiful view of the surroundings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The magnificent view of the Dalyan Delta and the amphitheater is relatively well preserved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"Personally, I love these ""ancient ruins"". You can walk for a few hours";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful and historically important ruins just across Dalyan. If you go up, I suggest you walk to the top of the hill behind the amphitheater, you will see a magnificent view of the ruins, Dalyan and the river delta. It can get very hot in the summer as there isn't much shade. I think my favorite time is May. Visited in July and found it quite warm. Mid-September and October are cooler, so take a good time to visit. In addition to the ruins to look at, there is plenty of wildlife to see if you keep your eyes peeled.;встречаются дикие ослы. Вход платный -14 лир с человека. Есть кафе. Иностранных туристов привозят сюда с экскурсиями;"российских не видели -скорее всего только по реке проводят на пляж и на грязевые ванны. А зря.""";https://www.google.com.tr/none;none;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a nice place to see the old antique buildings and the preserved church. If you go down and further, you can see the workers still putting out new stuff which is great to watch live.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
surprisingly beautiful;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
was here about 15 years ago and it was great. Some work is being done to preserve this ancient site and on top of that it was free. Now? You have to pay to look at the attempt to destroy the place. The amphitheater began to collapse. Its entrance is used as a goat barn. Some of the interiors have been dismantled and lost. Goats and cows running around trample the ruins. Most of the subdivisions were submerged. Some of the good old walkways have disappeared and have been replaced by other stones. What a shame for the authorities who have to deal with this. Surly their offices are in immaculate condition. Paid with UNESCO Money for the protection of ancient sites in Turkey. Shameful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Excellent site. They are slowly working to reveal more of the site. Very interesting and informative;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
wonderful view! Caution, the way up is not signposted, making it a pretty dangerous climb from right to left. Therefore, sturdy shoes are highly recommended! But the view totally makes up for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Thousand-year-old ruins from the Greek, Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods.....the theater is still in pretty good condition and ruins from different periods pollute the area. Amazing view of Dalyan and the river delta and the beach. The tombs of the dead are carved into the rocks about 1 km from the site and are quite visible from the center of Dalyan.... You must visit if you are in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
We were there at 7.15 but they didn't let us go to the ground.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's out of season right now. I loved the quiet and peaceful atmosphere of this time of year. The location is beautiful and the atmosphere is a feeling of historical presence. The world of yesterday is before your eyes. The feeling of a great past brought to view with a simple stroll.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
traveling through history learning a lot;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Amazing collection of historical relics including an amphitheater and very early Christian church. The views are great if you have the energy to climb Lion Rock.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
History just drips on you. Great experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Amazing historical place. The well-preserved amphitheater, baths and basilica are noteworthy. Entry is 17.5 lira. Preliminarily, it is desirable to read the description of the object on the Internet. You won't be wasting your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The hidden history behind the canals cruise. It's worth seeing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great), but also not worth highlighting. If you are staying in Dalyan and have half a day of free time, you can go to the opposite bank of the river for 20-25 liras (double direction), walk 2 km and you're there! 14 lira more for the original entrance);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the historical places of Western Anatolia.. You should go to the top of the castle.. So you can see all the geographical changes..;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
was there in mid-October. Peacefully quiet. First transfer by boat. Then walk to the excavations. I did not meet a tourist on the way. Well chickens. Nice comfortable walk. On the road, which is very beautiful, you pass by the royal tombs. The excavations were also worth the effort. It took half a day to get there and back. On the way, I bought a bottle of cold freshly squeezed pomegranate juice for 1 euro from a farmer's wife. Tasty. There are several women selling these juices, olives and other delicacies under a tree. It was a beautiful morning and it was great to do on your own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Nice place, interesting history;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An amazing site entrance fee is 8TL per person. You have to go there by boat from Daylan, we paid 40 Euros between 10:30-17:00, in addition to Kaunos, he dropped us off at turtle island itzuzu island at 2:30. The site is very well preserved and wonderfully beautiful, I sincerely invite you to visit it.;https://www.google.com.tr/none;none;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nice experience.Tractor ride was also an experience;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The Daylan River cruise is a wonderful experience. Beautiful view of the landscape park with lots of attractions, eg. Lykilian tombs set on steep cliffs, the walls of the Acropolis, a Roman fountain, a well-preserved theater from the 2nd century BC. For 1,500 spectators, the ruins of four temples from the Greek and Roman periods, the Roman baths and the 5th-8th. century Byzantine basilica.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Look from afar, the boat will come ashore but you can't go out) Everyone will run to the side of the boat to take a photo, nice but unimpressed! If there is a trip to the tombs and an interesting guide, then yes, but I do not recommend;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An abandoned place and not even a souvenir merchant;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great, you just have to come and explore the whole city. Ticket is 14tl (September 2020). .Then you can go to the nearby villages, go to the big lake and take a bath, explore the whole area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very interesting, lots of restoration work in progress, worth a visit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A very beautiful path to the monument, in a boat along a winding river in tall grass, even somewhat like Cambodia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An ancient city with a well-preserved amphitheater and many dilapidated buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Interesting place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You have to go here through the beautiful forest. The road is really beautiful! Many turtles walk there. The ruins are truly atmospheric. Suggested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Just like in petra jordan with ancient Roman ruins and other pre-Nabatean civilizations with rock-cut structures. Outdoor thermal baths. Boat trips along the river. Great restaurants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
An ancient city spread over a wide area. It's always improving as archaeologists get together more. There is an amphitheater, baths and many more ruined structures. Unbelievable! It's mind-blowing that a civilization more than 2,000 years old can be this complex and modern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Small excavated archaeological site with a fantastic amphitheater;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Maybe because it was cloudy because it didn't make a crazy impression. Brought to boats. Give it an hour. It takes 12-15 minutes to walk to Kaunus. The amphitheater is tatty (it would be possible to collect stones on each other, most of them were simply thrown away, they did not provide audio guides, there is a cafe, you can drink tea from a bag).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
nice place. And it's definitely a sight to behold. The only downside is the longer distance to Marmaris (our town of residence). The round trip took about 8 hours in total by boat. As a result, I enjoyed it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ruins are well documented with many informative notices. Brilliant amphitheater. Entrance fee is 10tL with reasonable prices and you can find cold and hot drinks etc. that are reasonably priced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Second visit in 20 years, much more has been uncovered over the years. With more payloads to be found in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A little more residue. More intense excavation slope. In a wonderful setting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Great place and atmosphere!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Dalyan is a small quiet place in a nature reserve where you can take boats to the beautiful Iztuzu Beach. The journey takes you across a river crossing the Kaunos Tombs. On the way back, you can visit the ancient city of Kaunos. Worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It seems that the city was once interesting, but in fact there are many ruins, some of which have been gradually rebuilt. We were here the second day after Ephesus and therefore Kaunos did not enter, Ephesus is much more interesting and here goats and donkeys graze in the area, as a result of which it turned out to be an impossible task to not participate in. rubbish, little information about the stands, plus the daytime heat and absence of shadows invalidated all impressions. We came to Kaunos from Dalyan, left the car in the parking lot and for 15 liras (that's the price of a two-way boat), our grandmother carried us to the other side of the river by boat. We walked 20-25 minutes to Kaunos. On the way, we admired the view of the Lycian tombs carved into the rocks, the cemetery and the pomegranate gardens. On the way back, we bought cold pomegranate and fresh orange juice from the locals (10 lira for 0.25 lira) and it really somehow saved us from the heat. I recommend visiting only if you are a big fan of antiquity and have previously collected information about the city itself on the Internet. Entry is 14 lira.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Worth seeing and fascinating;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's the most important historical place but it's very bad animal poop everywhere and most places are so unsafe it makes me sad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Lots of Greek ruins and lots of wild turtles running around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Worth visiting! We managed to execute everything very quickly in an hour, I asked for more time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Few tourists go there, but if you're in Dalyan for a boat trip, visiting the ruins of the city of Rome is definitely worth the short uphill walk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you're passing nearby, it's nice to stop for a coffee at the village cafes and then visit Kaunos. Nothing too special, just a simple archaeological site.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
What do I say, just say what you want to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Relax and enjoy the view;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ancient Roman theater ruins, great hot springs, as well as a nymph, agora, temple and sports facility. Not much actually remains, but the site is still interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Definitely worth going, then taking a boat trip to turtle island. Get some water hot hot. Some stunning views, baths, shopping mall, then to the existing tombs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
.Best location, great views.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Sorry for the people of Kaunos. Descendants of mosquitoes are still a problem today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's an extra city, not crowded, beautiful views, worth a visit, monuments are hard to come by. An intimate amphitheater and an old port. A very interesting river cruise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ruins of an ancient city always impress me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Effective visit;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Interesting, but they're still digging. The tractor was not working yesterday which takes you to the construction site so not good when you have to walk a km. 38°;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ruins in Turkey;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Antique, very well restored, remote and small parking lot, but very nice entrance 17.5 liras;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Well restored with a tractor ride to reach from the road. Be sure to bring a guide who will tell you the most interesting aspects of its long history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
easy to reach;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Good access to the ruins (with goats). You can walk around the amphitheater. Watch out for lizards and turtles in the bushes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
You can't get close, you can only look through the fence from afar;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very interesting place with no information stands and guides;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It only accepts lira at the box office!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful. great experience;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I love the amphitheater. you can climb up to the very top of the seats or stand in the middle of the stage and start monologues!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Extraordinary. A real city in the hills. It takes 3-4 hours to go all around. The most interesting - for an hour. Amphitheater is good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
river cruise overlooking the Lycian tombs was part of our boat trip from Turunc - excursion with a local private carrier - highly recommend;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A true miracle in an enviable environment;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a wonderful place. The only downside is the lack of information about the site and structures. Otherwise, it's an excellent site, especially for lovers of historical sites.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A mighty ancient city. Great impressions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Super apartment hotel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Kaunos is one of the most important cities of ancient Caria. It was a port city in ancient times. Dalyan is a very beautiful destination to visit with its cute delta and Kaunos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
I'm not a big fan of archaeological sites. You can see these tombs while cruising on a small boat. Knowledgeable and not boring.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Fantastic spot. You can easily spend a few hours here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It does not matter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a nice place with nice little hotels. A trip by boat to the largest reed area is definitely worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's beautiful I took a 2 hour trip from Dalyan to Kaunos but it's so beautiful;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Real ruins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful ruins to visit. Hint: Climb the castle above the Colosseum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
great place to visit. Wonderful view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Brilliant ancient ruins;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A great place to visit, with an ancient history, amazing view, the city of Dalyan is nearby, everything you need to have a good time on a vacation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
"In May 411, after demanding Alcibiades from the ambassadors of the Athenian oligarchy, he pledged that the Persians could build as many ships as they wanted, that Asia had the Ionian coast and could roam freely, Peisandro and other Athenian envoys broke negotiations with Alcibiades and the satrap Tisafernes. This situation, which seems to support the Athenian oligarchy with its use of Alcibiades, led its fleet to the ca. He decides to act again in favor of the defeated Spartans in 412. In Miletus, it went south and has existed since the winter of 412 BC. Stranded on the shores of the island of Rhodes, it has already exhausted its resources and maintenance. Tisafernes travels to Caunos, leaves the payment money to the Peloponnesian sailors, and signs the ""Third Contract"" with the Peloponnesian leaders, near Miletus.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the most beautiful historical places to see. I listened to the echoes of floyd through a bluetooth speaker in the theater... a tremendous spiritual act;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Temples carved into the rocks. Beautiful view from the riverbed. Great place for walking. I recommend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Excellent ancient city of Thombs and its ruins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Worth seeing as part of a larger trip but not alone. Some nice views but not a well maintained site.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Wonderful archaeological site. Take the rowing boat from Dalyan, you pass the nearby King's Tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ruins but interesting to walk around;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a very beautiful area, a lot of mosquitoes from 6 to 7 pm but nothing after that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
a very nice place;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A wonderful historical, interesting place with an amazing view of the area, highly recommended to visit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A well-preserved amphitheater, ruins of baths, a beautiful place, you can see it at your leisure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's incredible when you consider how long ago these were carved. But I just saw it from a boat in the river and the carved rock tombs felt very far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a very interesting place. Not good for those with mobility issues. Minimum shadow. I would recommend it to anyone interested in history and archeology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
A magnificent amphitheater and impressive ruins with stunning views of the surroundings and the sea, swamps, river and Dalyan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
One of the antqiue quotes in Turkey. Next to Dalyan, a place where you can enjoy half a day, coffee, lunch by the river.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
What a beautiful place to ride a bike. Take your bike on the ferry and have a picnic, honey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very Historic but unfortunately Turkish Government is not interested in this place;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It will definitely take you 2 hours to visit there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The Romans surprised as always! There are very few tourists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
love this place, just soaking up the atmosphere, no great views to wonder all day long;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Amazing place, must visit! Very interesting;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It is beautiful and the views are incredible. There is still acoustic in the theater.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Wonderful;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Very beautiful ancient Hellenistic/Roman city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
If you are in Dalyan go here. Although the distance is 1.5 kilometers, you can even go on foot, so bring a drink.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Nice view friendly people and along the way there are some nice fresh jams well worth trying;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Thermal showers and mud baths were really therapeutic and made my skin really soft. This was completely natural as opposed to some artificial ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Daylan's boat tour to the ancient city of Kaunos was one of the best days of the holiday. Pure nature and then the discovery of Kaunos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The place is really beautiful;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Beautiful old town! It is simply breathtaking to realize how old these walls are!;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
The ruins are fantastic and very extensive, we plan to spend a few hours here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
It's a very valuable journey. It's not expensive at all. Nice guide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
